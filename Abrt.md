# ABRT



[ABRT](https://fedorahosted.org/abrt/) is a tool that helps users to detect defects in applications and to create a bug report with all information needed by a maintainer to fix it. It uses plugin system to extend its functionality.
## Spacewalk & ABRT



The main purpose of this plug-in is to send number
of crashes that happened on a given machine back to the
spacewalk server and gain attention
of the sysadmin, who should investigate these
crashes and/or configure ABRT reporting so these
issues doesn't go unnoticed.

After installing 
`spacewalk-abrt` package `rhn-check` will automatically start reporting
ABRT information back to the server.



Currently, 
the number of crashes is shown only on
system detail page (`systems/details/Overview.do`)
under _Application crashes_ header. If there are
no ABRT data available, it prompts the user for
installing `spacewalk-abrt` package.

Later, this feature can be extended to
- display data on summary (`YourRhn.do`) page;
- collect more information about crashes.

Following issues were identified recently:
 - if the `spacewalk-abrt` package is removed from
 the system, data on the server remain unchanged,
 showing inaccurate information;
 - time of the last crash should be present.
