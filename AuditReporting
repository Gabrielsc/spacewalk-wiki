= Audit Reporting =

With Spacewalk 2.0 we started to log Spacewalk user's events.
So we can track which user did what operation, as an example who has deleted a system from Spacewalk server. 

== What gets logged ==

To catch all the events, the logging is implemented on the database level.

Currently the auditing is enabled on tables:
 - rhnUser
 - rhnServer
 - rhnServerGroup

so we can find out, who, when and what changed within these tables.

== Usage ==

{{{
# spacewalk-report audit-users
}}}
