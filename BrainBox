This is just a page to collect brainwaves/ideas/evil-thoughts for Spacewalk.

 * HelpSystem to make help a bit easier to work with.
 * PathToPostgreSql - Don't get too excited, yet.  This path is very long but worth it.
 * [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/SRPMSyncSpec SRPM Sync] to enable sync of source RPM content via satellite-sync.
 * Provide a UI for folks to edit/create comps files and associated package/group entries for custom content to use with yum client
 * UserPermissions - Discussion around implementing fine grained user permissions.
 * [http://fedorahosted.org/func] instead of osad? What are the advantages/disadvantages? Is it possible?
    * half of an answer:  func can change, and it's probably possible :) Let's start a discussion on the ML. Do we have a page about OSAD here? -- mpd
 * upgrade configuration management engine? Integrate with puppet or cfengine, let's avoid enhancing our current implementation.
 * upgrade monitoring engine?
 * easier support for importing content from multiple distributions and managing those distributions in parallel 
 * streamline development process to encourage more contributions, see [http://209.85.215.104/search?q=cache:0hNSibSYPmYJ:www.people.hbs.edu/cbaldwin/DR2/BaldwinArchPartAll.pdf+%22architecture+of+participation%22+harvard&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a The Architecture of Participation: ...]
 * decompose Spacewalk into an aggregation of OSS projects, composed of seperate subprojects that can be used by other projects
 * continually ask the question: what use cases are new and not covered by the app because of previous datacenter focus, if any?  Where can it and it's subprojects grow?
 * enable usage of Transifex
 * integration with koji -- this is building the packages in koji which will occur when we submit to Fedora.
 * finish migrating [RemainingPxtPages perl pages] to Java, and remove the perl stack entirely.
 * integration with rancid (http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) (suggested by Alticon-Brian in IRC)
 * [wiki:Deb_support_in_spacewalk add support for deb packages/Debian]
 * add support for external repositories so that Spacewalk doesn't have to have a local copy of all RPMs, just retrieves the headers in the same way yum does and can direct subscribed clients to download directly from the 3rd party repo. (Proxy already does this. What is the use case that YUM covers differently?)
 * add support for Jumpstarting Solaris
 * [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=487666 IPv6]
   * note that Oracle libraries use gethostbyaddr and friends, so may not be usable under IPv6
 * make db-control usable with Oracle XE
 * Provide a tree structure with a depth greater than 1 for the Software Channel Subscriptions
 * Provide a way to add arbitrary metadata to any given repository. Like modifyrepo does in createrepo.
 * [wiki:MySQL_support MySQL as database backend]
 * allow system.scheduleScriptRun to work with scripts that have been saved in the database. This way scripts can be re-used and later maybe even attached to triggers like configchannel actions.
 * [wiki:Container_support Containers in Spacewalk]
 * Replace the current "Custom Build Content Management System" with one that is Open Source (GPL'd) like [http://www.alfresco.com Alfresco].  This could replace the legacy PERL/RPC scheme with a more current Javascript/REST scheme.  Alfresco is willing to contribute to this development as there is a need for an Alfresco "Network" and we don't want to reinvent the wheel.  If you would like to contact me: lee.faus at alfresco dot com.
 * Automatic change logging of Kickstart profiles - Starting with kickstart pre/post revisioning.  https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/KickstartScriptRevisioning details coec's current thinking on the matter.
 * Expand macros to have conditional logic and loops in config files using custom system info or other values stored in satellite/spacewalk.  {| if rhn.system.custom_info(foo) == 'bar' display 'foo' otherwise display 'not found' |}.  
 * debuginfo sync - enable sync of debuginfo packages via satellite-sync.
 * download packages using torrent protocol
 * enable package/package group selection via a GUI which shows available package/package groups for that distribution
