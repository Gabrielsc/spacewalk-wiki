This is just a page to collect brainwaves/ideas/evil-thoughts for Spacewalk.
 * Inter-satellite-sync 
   * Activations Keys, Kickstart profiles & Solaris content
 * Asset identification
 * Associate a config file with a remote command to allow e.g. dependent service restart after config file deployment. It should be possible to define pre or post deployment scripts.
      * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] Seconded...but this should include the ability to tie scripts with RPM and/or erratum deployment as well
 * Enable "superadmins" to select the current working orginization from a drop down menu, instead of being forced to logout and login as a specific user for that organization.
    * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] Seconded!
 * [wiki:Features/SupportUser Support User]
 * API-only user, with access to only specific API's.  Or a way to login to the API from a client without having to store username/password in cleartext.
 * Usecase deployment - make initial enable & deployment of the following simple 
   * Remote Commands, Configuration Management, Monitoring 
 * [GeneralImprovements General Improvements]
 * Start looking at func as possible future alternative to osad, or AMQP (with osad/osa-dispatcher) [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=453459 bugzilla 453459]
 * DeltaRpmSupport
 * Integration with [http://www.jasperforge.org/jaspersoft/opensource/business_intelligence/jasperreports/ JasperReports]
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] not sure how important this is to Spacewalk. -- jmrodri
 * HelpSystem to make help a bit easier to work with.
 * [wiki:PostgreSQL PostgreSQL Support] - content sync, rhnpush, registration and yum operations work
 * [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/SRPMSyncSpec SRPM Sync] to enable sync of source RPM content via satellite-sync.
 * Provide a UI for folks to edit/create comps files and associated package/group entries for custom content to use with yum client
 * UserPermissions - Discussion around implementing fine grained user permissions.
 * [http://fedorahosted.org/func func] instead of osad? What are the advantages/disadvantages? Is it possible?
    * half of an answer:  func can change, and it's probably possible :) Let's start a discussion on the ML. Do we have a page about OSAD here? -- mpd
    * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] probably should be done considering the recent jabberd trouble we've had. -- jmrodri
 * upgrade configuration management engine? Integrate with puppet or cfengine, let's avoid enhancing our current implementation.
   * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] to integrate with puppet -- jmrodri
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] [wiki:Why_not_to_use_a_configuration_management_engine Why not to use a configuration management engine] -- jvzantvoort(jydawg)
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] I think spacewalk has a great foundation for config management and should be expanded.  No other tool has the ability to control access to files, thus preventing accidents.
   * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] +1 Puppet integration.  Puppet has really started to blossom in the last few years and is gaining a real foothold in Corporate land.  I would suggest it's the "best of breed" that Spacewalk could really do with integrating -- Duncan
 * upgrade monitoring engine?
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] let's not UPGRADE it, let's integrate with something else. -- jmrodri
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] Agreed, could there be some integration with NRPE or something similar to NPC (http://trac2.assembla.com/npc/) -- Phil
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] +1 this idea.  Nagios is gaining more ground and provides "best of breed" monitoring solution that should provide excellent integration with Spacewalk. -- Duncan
 * easier support for importing content from multiple distributions and managing those distributions in parallel 
   * ? Is this the NEVRA issue? or something else? -- jmrodri
 * streamline development process to encourage more contributions, see [http://209.85.215.104/search?q=cache:0hNSibSYPmYJ:www.people.hbs.edu/cbaldwin/DR2/BaldwinArchPartAll.pdf+%22architecture+of+participation%22+harvard&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a The Architecture of Participation: ...]
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]]/[[Image(action-add.gif)]] what are some of the hurdles today that concern people? I am all for making things easier, but I don't know what the problems are with this? Spacewalk is NOT a small project so it's not as easy as {git clone ... ; ./build all}. But I think we've done a fine job with making it much better than it was before by basing it on an installed version. -- jmrodri
 * decompose Spacewalk into an aggregation of OSS projects, composed of separate subprojects that can be used by other projects
   * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] cobbler integration is a step in this direction. Though we need a bigger architectural plan to make this work. -- jmrodri
 * continually ask the question: what use cases are new and not covered by the app because of previous datacenter focus, if any?  Where can it and it's subprojects grow?
 * integration with koji -- this is building the packages in koji which will occur when we submit to Fedora.
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]]/[[Image(action-add.gif)]] I'm not sure what this does for us? unless it's the ability to get koji content into Spacewalk after building? If that's the case then I'm ok with it. -- jmrodri
 * finish migrating [RemainingPxtPages perl pages] to Java, and remove the perl stack entirely.
   * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] this really has been the piece that has held this project behind. We REALLY need to just finish this up and kill off the perl stack (web side) -- jmrodri
 * integration with rancid (http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) (suggested by Alticon-Brian in IRC)
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] I don't think this buys us anything, should be part of the integration with a different monitoring system. -- jmrodri
 * [wiki:Deb_support_in_spacewalk add support for deb packages/Debian]
   * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] this would be useful -- jmrodri
 * add support for external repositories so that Spacewalk doesn't have to have a local copy of all RPMs, just retrieves the headers in the same way yum does and can direct subscribed clients to download directly from the 3rd party repo. (Proxy already does this. What is the use case that YUM covers differently?)
 * add support for Jumpstarting Solaris
 * [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=487666 IPv6]
   * note that Oracle libraries use gethostbyaddr and friends, so may not be usable under IPv6
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] when IPv6 becomes the std, then we can spend the time doing it. I keep seeing comments about things not working with IPv6 but who's using it now? -- jmrodri
 * make db-control usable with Oracle XE
 * Provide a tree structure with a depth greater than 1 for the Software Channel Subscriptions
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] What does having a depth greater than 1 buy us? I'd rather remove the hieararchy altogether and go with something more like tags ala [http://www.flickr.com/help/tags/ flickr]. -- jmrodri
 * Provide a way to add arbitrary metadata to any given repository. Like modifyrepo does in createrepo.
   * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] seems generally useful
 * [wiki:MySQL_support MySQL as database backend]
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] honestly this doesn't make much sense until PostgreSQL is done.
 * allow system.scheduleScriptRun to work with scripts that have been saved in the database. This way scripts can be re-used and later maybe even attached to triggers like configchannel actions.
 * [wiki:Container_support Containers in Spacewalk]
   * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] I like this idea, it's something we've needed for some time. -- jmrodri
 * Replace the current "Custom Build Content Management System" with one that is Open Source (GPL'd) like [http://www.alfresco.com Alfresco].  This could replace the legacy PERL/RPC scheme with a more current Javascript/REST scheme.  Alfresco is willing to contribute to this development as there is a need for an Alfresco "Network" and we don't want to reinvent the wheel.  If you would like to contact me: lee.faus at alfresco dot com.
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] This request doesn't make much sense.  What Alfresco 'manages' is much more suited to documents than packages. Sure packages can be considered content, but I think the workflows are much different. -- jmrodri
 * Automatic change logging of Kickstart profiles - Starting with kickstart pre/post revisioning.  https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/KickstartScriptRevisioning details coec's current thinking on the matter.
 * Expand macros to have conditional logic and loops in config files using custom system info or other values stored in satellite/spacewalk.  {| if rhn.system.custom_info(foo) == 'bar' display 'foo' otherwise display 'not found' |}.  
 * debuginfo sync - enable sync of debuginfo packages via satellite-sync.
 * download packages using torrent protocol
   * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] Not going to happen. What does this mean? yum / up2date can't use torrents. I don't think this feature makes sense. -- jmrodri
   * I thought about something similar to [http://wiki.debian.org/DebTorrent DebTorrent] -- msuchy
 * enable package/package group selection via a GUI which shows available package/package groups for that distribution
   * [[Image(action-add.gif)]]/[[Image(action-del.gif)]] this would be along the lines of using tags to group packages. I'm not in favor of bolting this functionality onto the existing model, but replace it with tags. -- jmrodri
 * enable uploads of (single or max 5)RPMS into the system from the web page, so a user does not have to have a login on the console of the server - Antoine
   * [[Image(action-add.gif)]]  this is an excellent idea. we can do what numerous photo sites do with uploading. -- jmrodri
 * Ability to save arbitrary script within satellite for reuse (be able to save a script you use a lot) -- Antoine
 * Manage chkconfig via a kewl webinterface on the satellite -- Antoine
 * Ability to control activation keys with editor and comments -- Antoine
 * Allow user-defined types for custom info items -- Antoine
 * Make it possible to subscribe to Errata and create the errata to subscribe to -- red
  * [[Image(action-add.gif)]]/[[Image(action-del.gif)]] Lots of work, but also great benefit -- red
 * ...or maybe create an option to create stupid standard errata (like one for each update/rpm without any text, just to allow the pushing of updates to clients) automatically -- red
  * [[Image(action-add.gif)]]/[[Image(action-del.gif)]] Fine enough to at least enable the pushing to the clients, but creating errata just for that?! -- red
 * ...or make it possible to push updates/rpm to the clients instead of errata only -- red
  * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] Enables pushing of updates to clients without anyone having to write errata - might just suffice for lots of use cases -- red
 * Manage OpenVZ Containers
  * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] Seconded. -- phil
 * Allow a channel to be available as a raw yum repo.  This would work for building tools like mock.  I often have to keep rpms around in 2 spots so I can perform mock biulds.  Please, please fix this. --stahnma
  * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] Seconded, it would also make migration, manual changes easier? An export as yum repo hierarchy button somewhere? -- Phil
 * [wiki:Per_Channel_Vars Per Channel Vars for Config Channels]
 * Allow postinstall actions for the server. E.g. force software and configuration updates, set custom variables, send mail.
  * [[Image(action-del.gif)]] - can be already done using System details -> Software -> Install -> select some package -> Install -> Run command
  * I mean, postinstall of a server, not a package. the '%post' part of a kickstart if you will.
  * [[Image(action-add.gif)]] +1 for Postinstall of server.  Have done this many times by writing large series of scripts which are then deployed by Config Channels via Activation Keys.  Then builds up to an init.d type of environment where all scripts in this deployed directory are run.  It works, but it's fiddly.
 * [wiki:Features/NonLatinCharacters non-Latin characters in domain names]
 * Integration with some sort of FIM such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDE_(software) AIDE], such features as exporting the compiled database back to the spacewalk server and comparison of databases and file hashes between Groups/SSMs. I have clusters of machines that need to be kept consistent, which is harder than it sounds when some are taken out of service for developers or tweaked for special purposes. Plus security obviously. --Phil
 * Addition of a GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication method in place of the RHNSD and SSH method for remote client access. Instead of providing the identity file and a user for SSHing (shared keys are banned and impractical in my environment) I'd like to use my existing automaton user and distribute his key tab so that a simple kinit would allow password-less SSH to client machines. --Phil
 * PAM authentication to be extended so that local GIDs can be mapped to organisations. --Phil
 * See above about NRPE and NPC but integration with Cacti and Nagios perhaps? I know Redhat has "func" but they aren't quite the same and Nagios + Cacti + NPC is becoming an almost defacto standard in quite a few places I've worked/consulted. --Phil
 * New page for signing and uploading your own packages.  A browse button for selecting the rpm you want to upload, then a multi-select list of channels you want to upload to. The rpm would be automatically signed by your rpm key specified in /root/.rpmmacros .  --Josh
 * Default base channel for non-Redhat supplied channels. --heydrick [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=559370 bugzilla 559370]
 * Add NIM on Linux support, based largely around straight TFTP, a Network Installation Manager is used to boot, update and manage AIX servers, IBM have already packaged NIMOL in PRM form for their engineers to use on Linux laptops at client sites, unsure as to feasibility of managing spot sources and LPP in spacewalk?

 * Spacewalk can serve metalink file with list of Spacewalk Proxies, from which can download package too. --msuchy
 * Integrate Clickheat as a method for determining how the UI is used.  Determine some (optional) method to "phone home" data that can be used to aggregate usage data for future UI improvements.
  * http://www.labsmedia.com/clickheat/index.html --cswiii
 * replace ssh probes in monitoring with regular scripts from remote action (will imply usage of osad).
 * implement native [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ systemd] services.
