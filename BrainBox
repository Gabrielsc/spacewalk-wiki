This is just a page to collect brainwaves/ideas/evil-thoughts for Spacewalk.

 * NevraIssue Handle package with the same EVRA within the same org
 * PathToPostgreSql - Don't get too excited, yet.  This path is very long but worth it.
 * Provide a UI for folks to edit/create comps files and associated package/group entries for custom content to use with yum client
 * UserPermissions - Discussion around implementing fine grained user permissions.
 * [http://fedorahosted.org/func] instead of osad? What are the advantages/disadvantages? Is it possible?
    * half of an answer:  func can change, and it's probably possible :) Let's start a discussion on the ML. Do we have a page about OSAD here? -- mpd
 * upgrade configuration management engine? Integrate with puppet or cfengine, let's avoid enhancing our current implementation.
 * upgrade monitoring engine?
 * easier support for importing content from multiple distributions and managing those distributions in parallel 
 * streamline development process to encourage more contributions, see [http://209.85.215.104/search?q=cache:0hNSibSYPmYJ:www.people.hbs.edu/cbaldwin/DR2/BaldwinArchPartAll.pdf+%22architecture+of+participation%22+harvard&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a The Architecture of Participation: ...]
 * decompose Spacewalk into an aggregation of OSS projects, composed of seperate subprojects that can be used by other projects
 * continually ask the question: what use cases are new and not covered by the app because of previous datacenter focus, if any?  Where can it and it's subprojects grow?
 * enable usage of Transifex
 * integration with koji -- this is building the packages in koji which will occur when we submit to Fedora.
 * finish migrating [RemainingPxtPages perl pages] to Java, and remove the perl stack entirely.
 * integration with rancid (http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) (suggested by Alticon-Brian in IRC)
 * add support for deb packages/Debian
 * add support for external repositories so that Spacewalk doesn't have to have a local copy of all RPMs, just retrieves the headers in the same way yum does and can direct subscribed clients to download directly from the 3rd party repo.
 * add support for Jumpstarting Solaris
