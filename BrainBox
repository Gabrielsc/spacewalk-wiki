  * [http://fedorahosted.org/func] instead of osad? What are the advantages/disadvantages? Is it possible?
     * half of an answer:  func can change, and it's probably possible :) Let's start a discussion on the ML. Do we have a page about OSAD here? -- mpd
  * make more pieces of Sat seperate open source sub-projects that other projects can use.  what is interesting?
  * upgrade configuration management engine?
  * upgrade monitoring engine?
  * easier support for importing content from multiple distributions and managing those distributions in parallel 
   * Handle package with the same EVRA within the same org
  * streamline development process to encourage more contributions, see "architecture of open source collaboration"

  * decompose Spacewalk into an aggregation of OSS projects, composed of seperate subprojects that are usable seperately
  * continually ask the question: what use cases are new and not covered by the app because of previous datacenter focus, if any?  Where can it and it's subprojects grow?
  * enable for usage with Transifex
