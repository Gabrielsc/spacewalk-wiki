= Branching =
Our basic branching philosophy is: 
 1. the main development and bugfixes go into '''master'''
 2. when stabilizing code for a release, cut a branch from '''master'''
 3. branch as late as possible
 4. when committing code for a release, the code goes in the release branch(es) (if any) and '''master'''.
 5. experimental stuff and big changes might have their own branches

See [http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=spacewalk.git;a=blob_plain;f=documentation/branches.txt; branches.txt] for the most up to date branches.

The way we work right now, you will check everything into '''master'''. If there is a branch for the target release(s), you should check the code into the branch(es) as well. If you have code that needs to go in a release between the latest branch and '''master''', then you need to have someone create a branch. 

So:

The current version is x.y.0. It was built from the RELEASE-x.y branch.

{{{
            ---RELEASE-x.y-----------------------------------
           /   (Changes for release x.y.1 and beyond go here)
          /
         /
-'''master'''---/---(All changes go here)-------------------
             Releases x.y+1 (or x+1.0) will be built from this code
             eventually.
}}}

If you have a fix that is destined for release x.y.1 or later, it goes into the RELEASE-x.y branch. Other changes go into '''master'''. If it turns out we need to check in changes that are to go into release x.y.z (where z > 1) but *not* into x.y.1, then you must have a branch created:

{{{
                         ---RELEASE-x.y.1--------------------
                        /  (Canges for x.y.1 go here)
                       /
     ---RELEASE-x.y---/--------------------------------------
    /   (Changes for x.y.1 *and* x.y.z and beyond go here)
   /
H-/---------(Yes, all changes still go here too)-------------
}}}

An example:

Development for the 0.2 release is proceeding. Code is being checked into '''master''', and there are no active branches. The version files in '''master''' contain 0.2 {release}.{rhel_ver}. Eventually 0.2 becomes stable enough that we are ready to build RPMS, or a developer is ready to work on release 0.3. 

So, we create the branch. There may be point releases, so we name the branch appropriately.
{{{
git checkout master
git pull (make sure things are clean)
git checkout -b release-0.2
git push origin release-0.2:refs/heads/RELEASE-0.2
git checkout --track -b my-branchname origin/RELEASE-0.2
}}}

RELEASE-0.2 branch will then be used to build any 0.2 point releases (including .0).

So far so good. One problem: The version files in the branch and in '''master''' are identical! If we build RPMs from both the branch and '''master''', we will end up with version conflicts, and be very sad. Now we can go back to '''master''' and fix the version file there. 

{{{
git checkout master

PUT IN COMMAND TO SWITCH VERSIONS TO 0.3

git commit
git push
}}}

All code committed to release branches must also be included in master. (git cherry-pick and git merge very useful for this)
