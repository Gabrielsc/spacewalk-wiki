In general we try to follow the defined coding conventions, but there are probably cases where we didn't.

If you change database schema ([http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/?p=spacewalk.git;a=tree;f=schema/spacewalk/rhnsat schema/spacewalk/rhnsat]), make sure you put correct upgrade script into [http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/?p=spacewalk.git;a=tree;f=schema/spacewalk/upgrade schema/spacewalk/upgrade/spacewalk-<version1>-spacewalk-<version2>]. Use some digits at the start of the filename to force deterministic ordering of these upgrade scripts. Make the name descriptive a bit, put name of the database object you change there and maybe also some reason (column name, not-null, whatever). The suffix has to be '''.sql'''.

Look at [http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/?p=spacewalk.git;a=tree;f=schema/spacewalk/upgrade/spacewalk-0.2-spacewalk-0.3 schema/spacewalk/upgrade/spacewalk-0.2-spacewalk-0.3] or [http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/?p=spacewalk.git;a=tree;f=schema/spacewalk/upgrade/satellite-5.1-spacewalk-0.2 schema/spacewalk/upgrade/satellite-5.1-spacewalk-0.2] if you need inspiration, or ask.
