== Getting started ==

This assumes you have pushed the spacewalk client repo to your spacewalk server and subscribed a server to it.

1. Install the client utilities:
   yum install rhncfg*
2. Enable config management:
   rhn-actions-control --enable-all
3. Within the webUI create a configuration channel and add files
4. Subscribe the client to the configuration channel
5. Either schedule a config deploy from the webUI or run 'rhncfg-client get' on the client

== FAQ ==

1.  Can I automatically restart a service after a congfig file is deployed?
       No, you can schedule a separate remote command though.  Hopefully this is coming soon.

2.  Can I upload files to the local sandbox or override list from the client (not to a config channel).
       No, you can only upload to a specified config channel from the client.
