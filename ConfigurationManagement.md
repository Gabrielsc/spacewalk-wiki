## Getting started

This assumes you have pushed the Spacewalk client repository to your Spacewalk server and subscribed a server to it.

 * Install the client utilities:
    ```bash
    yum install rhncfg*
    ```
 * Enable config management:
    ```bash
    rhn-actions-control --enable-all
    ```
 * Within the web GUI create a configuration channel and add files.
 * Subscribe the client to the configuration channel.
 * Either schedule a config deploy from the webUI or run 'rhncfg-client get' on the client.

## FAQ

1. Can I automatically restart a service after a configuration file is deployed?

   No, you can schedule a separate remote command though.  Hopefully this is coming soon.

2. Can I upload files to the local sandbox or override list from the client (not to a configuration channel)?
   No, you can only upload to a specified configuration channel from the client.
