== Coding ==

Are you familier with Python, Java or Perl? Look at some [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&bug_status=NEW&product=Spacewalk&classification=Other reported bugs] and 
pick up one. Assign it to yourself and start working on it. When you are done send us [PatchProcess a patch].
Did not find anything interresting for you? Check [BrainBox brainbox] or come with your own idea.

Did you write some usefull script which use Spacewalk API? Share it with others!

== Testing ==

Just use Spacewalk and report bugs you may find.

Go through [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&classification=Other&product=Spacewalk&query_format=advanced&order=bug_id&query_based_on= bug list] and test older bugs whether are they still valid. Sometimes bug is fixed as side effect of other fix. You may find such case and close bug without any work!

== Documentation ==

A lot of spacewalk programs or configuration files do not have a man page. Do you want to write it?

We need general documentation of Spacewalk. You did not find documentation for task you are currently doing? Just create new wiki page and document what you did.
Some existing documentation is outdated and you may review it and update it.

Although we have some [http://www.redhat.com/spacewalk/documentation/ documentation], we still have wide areas undocumented. Just start reading documentation and document it. We use [http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-docstring.html epydoc] style for python and Javadoc for Java. The documentation is inline in code. So will send result as [PatchProcess a patch]. This is best start if you want to start coding, but you are not familier with our code base.

== Help others ==

Or you can just hang on [WikiStart#Communication IRC or mailing list] and try to answer question others may have.

== Money ==

We could not accept any money directly. But since Spacewalk is heavily sponsored by [http://www.redhat.com/ Red Hat], if you [http://shop.redhat.de/store/rhnw/RH13-085-EN/en?set_language=en&cl=en buy RHN Satellite], you directly support development of Spacewalk.
