
== Deb support in Spacewalk ==

Hi, my name is Lukas Durfina. I am studying on Faculty of Information Technology,
Brno University of Technology. In my master thesis I am going to work on support
deb systems/packages in spacewalk. My technical consultant is Miroslav Suchy,
RHN Satellite Engineer.

On this page I would describe progress of my work.



'''December 2008'''[[BR]]

I have 2 virtual servers with CentOS. On 1 of them spacewalk is installed, second
will be for testing. Now I am going to install debian on third virtual server
and then I will start work on creating deb packages.

'''January 2009'''[[BR]]

Now I have virtual Debian server. I started to experiment with debian packages.
I created deb package for rhnlib.
