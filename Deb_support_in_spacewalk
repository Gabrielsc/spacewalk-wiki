
== Deb support in Spacewalk ==

Hi, my name is Lukas Durfina. I am studying on Faculty of Information Technology,
Brno University of Technology. In my master thesis I am going to work on support
deb systems/packages in spacewalk. My technical consultant is Miroslav Suchy,
RHN Satellite Engineer.

== Debian repo with spacewalk packages ==

You can test my packages, which are stored in this repo:

http://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xdurfi00/spacewalk_debian/

configuration for sources.list:

deb http://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xdurfi00/spacewalk_debian/ sid main[[BR]]

deb-src http://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xdurfi00/spacewalk_debian/ sid main

'''ATTENTION: Packages are highly experimental.''' [[BR]]

Pulbic key is in attachment on the bottom of site.[[BR]]
Or use this:

{{{
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 121A13C3
apt-key add ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
}}}


== Example of creating package ==

 * wget http://www.redhat.com/spacewalk/source/0.3/rhn-client-tools-0.4.17-10.fc9.src.rpm
 * rpm2cpio rhn-client-tools-0.4.17-10.fc9.src.rpm | cpio -idmv --no-absolute-filenames



== History ==

On this page I would describe progress of my work.

'''December 2008'''[[BR]]

I have 2 virtual servers with CentOS. On 1 of them spacewalk is installed, second
will be for testing. Now I am going to install debian on third virtual server
and then I will start work on creating deb packages.

'''January 2009'''[[BR]]

Now I have virtual Debian server. I started to experiment with debian packages.
I created deb package for rhnlib. Debian repo for getting packages was established.
