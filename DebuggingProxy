== Debugging Proxy ==

A few pointers for issues you might run into with Proxy:

Useful log files:
 * /var/log/httpd/* - Apache logs
 * /var/log/squid/* - Squid logs
 * /var/log/rhn/rhn_proxy_broker.log - Proxy Broker Server
 * /var/log/rhn/rhn_proxy_redirect.log - SSL Redirect Server

Config files:
 * /etc/httpd/conf.d/*.conf
 * /etc/rhn/rhn.conf
 * /etc/squid/squid.conf
 * /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date

You can raise the debug level in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf to increase logging to the Proxy Broker and SSL Redirect logs - set to a value between 0 (default) and 9 (loads of debugging info).
