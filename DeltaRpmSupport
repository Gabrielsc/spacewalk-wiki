== FAQ ==
* What is a delta rpm?
   * It is a collection of the binary diffs between all the individual files of two different versions of the same package with the rpm header of the new package prepended to the file.

* Can rpm work directly with drpms?
   * No, the full rpm must be recreated before installing.  Rpm itself has no idea what a drpm actually is and will try (and fail) to install it like a normal rpm.

* Can yum work directly with drpms themselves?
   * No, yum (with the presto yum plugin or a similiar plugin) can only work with drpms if they are in an appropriate repo.  The plugin itself recomposes the rpm into its original form before having yum install it.  

== Common Commands ==

Create a drpm:
     {{{makedeltarpm  oldrpm.rpm  newrpm.rpm  deltarpm.drpm}}}

Create drpms from a full repo:
	{{{createdeltarpms  ./repo ./repo/DRPMS}}}

Reconstruct original rpm using on disk installation:
 	{{{applydeltarpm  delta.drpm  new.rpm}}}

Reconstruct original rpm using an old rpm:
 	{{{applydeltarpm  -r old.rpm  delta.drpm  new.rpm}}}

Create a presto repo:
	{{{createprestorepo ./repo}}}
Then to finish the deal:
        {{{ modifyrepo  ./repodata/prestodelta.xml  ./repodata/ }}}
