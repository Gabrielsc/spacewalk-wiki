The below instructions are how to set up the Spacewalk Development Enviroment into a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 server.  Future versions will include instructions and support for Fedora and other Linux variants.

= Spacewalk Runtime Environment Prerequisite =

In order to setup the  Spacewalk development environment, you first need to have a running version of Spacewalk installed following the instructions in [HowToInstall Spacewalk Installation Instructions].

= Git Prerequisite =
To setup the sources follow the instructions in [GitGuide#InstallGit Install Git] and [GitGuide#ClonetheSpacewalkgitrepository clone the Spacewalk repository].


= Installation =
 * {{{sudo service rhn-satellite stop}}}
 * {{{sudo yum install ant-nodeps junit ant-junit java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel}}}
 * {{{sudo rpm -Uvh http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/jpackage/1.7/generic/free/RPMS/ivy-1.3.1-1jpp.noarch.rpm}}}
 * {{{cd $GITDIR/spacewalk/java}}}
 * {{{ant all }}}
 * {{{ant create-webapp-dir}}}
 * {{{sudo ant install-devel}}} 
 * {{{sudo service rhn-satellite start}}}

Your development environment should now be ready to go.
