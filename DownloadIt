== Source ==

=== Getting source code with git ===

Spacewalk uses [http://git.or.cz git] for source control.

To checkout the latest version from git:

{{{
git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/
}}}

If you have a firewall that is blocking the git clone operation, you can also clone over http, although it is slower:

{{{
git clone http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/
}}}

You can view the source via [http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=spacewalk.git;a=summary gitweb]

=== Commiter Git Information ===

In general, we want folks to send [PatchProcess patches to the list].  If you have commit access to Spacewalk, however, you can use the following URL:

{{{
git clone ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/

{{{
git clone ssh://USERNAME@git.fedorahosted.org/git/spacewalk.git/
}}}

Replacing USERNAME with your FAS username.

=== Source RPMs ===

Source packages [http://spacewalk.redhat.com/source/ are available from spacewalk.redhat.com/source/].

== RPM Package Signing ==

We use a number of GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) keys to sign our software packages. The necessary public keys are included in relevant products and are used automatically to verify software updates. You can also check the packages manually using the keys on this page.

To verify a RPM package for Spacewalk, run the command
{{{
rpm --checksig -v <filename>.rpm
}}}

The output of this command will show you if the package is signed, and which key was used to sign it.
