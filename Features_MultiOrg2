= Background =

The multiple organization support feature in Spacewalk allows you to partition your Spacewalk server into different organizations that each have their own set of entitlements, systems, and content that other organizations on the Spacewalk server cannot access.

What is in Spacewalk right now is a first cut of this feature. There are a number of improvements that should be made to the feature to make it more usable.

= Requirements =

(These is just a very high-level and short list of bullet points. We'll be filling this out later as the requirements are more solidified.)

 * Content Sharing - for now this means organizations will be able to share their custom channels with each other. 
 * System Migration - migrate a system from one organization to another without deleting its profile and re-registering it to the new organization.
 * [wiki:/Features/MultiOrg2/TrustRelationships] - trust relationships between organizations will enable the above two features - if you don't have a trust relationship with a given org, you can't see any of the content it shares with you nor can you migrate systems to it or can systems from it be migrated to your organization.
