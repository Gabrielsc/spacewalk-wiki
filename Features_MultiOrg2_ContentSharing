=== The Sharer ===

 * under custom channel details: radio button: private (default), public, public only to these trusted orgs: [ ] 
   * turns out there is already per-user in-org subscriber ACLs here, so I reimagined the main custom channel details page and added the org sharing controls to a new access control section. We'll also add a new tab to check on and off org's access to the channel. 
 * list of orgs to check on/off for access to custom channel (new 'organization' tab in the custom channel details screens) 
 * new channel filters: 
   * my channels i'm sharing 
   * my private channels

 * new channel filter 
   * shared channels from other orgs
