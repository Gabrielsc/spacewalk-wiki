== Spacewalk Administrator View ==

The Spacewalk administrator will be the user role authorized to create and remove trusts between organizations. Trusts are bi-directional, so if the spacewalk admin sets up a trust between org a and org b, org a can see org b's shared content AND org b can see org a's shared content.

=== Viewing Trusts Across Organizations ===

For an overview of which organizations have trusts set up and how many they have set up, the current 'Organizations' overview page (/rhn/admin/multiorg/Organizations.do) will be expanded to include a column to indicate trusts. See mockup below.
