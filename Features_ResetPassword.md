# Reset-Email Workflow: Design Thoughts

## Problem Statement




Currently, Spacewalk can send plaintext emails to users with their passwords. This happens in two cases:

 * Initial login creation
 * The result of using the 'Forgot my Password' page

This is a security exposure. Best-practice for the current web is to send an email with a one-time-use link, that authenticates and leads the user to setting their password themselves.

The orignating BZ is [Bug 608355](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608355) - Password not to be sent in clear text via email after creating new user on Red Hat Satellite.
It has been cloned for Spacewalk as [Bug 1263799](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1263799).

Hee's a very thorough description of the problem, and of solution(s) to it: [Everything you ever wanted to know about building a secure password reset feature](http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/05/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know.html) This is going to be our de-facto design doc.

The approach that Spacewalk is taking in response to [Bug 608355](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608355) is as follows:

 * !Creation/Reset requests send email to the affected email address
 * Email contains a one-time time-limited random token
 * Token, time-of-creation, and still-valid flag stored in a table, along with the user-id of the affected user
   * This table exists so that we can have a permanent record of every password-reset-request, as an audit-record
   * Any existing entries for the affected user are marked as invalid before we create/send the new one - There Can Be Only One!
 * Tokens are valid if and only if (is-valid == true) && (now - time-created < reset-token-validity-period)
   * expiration-period is controlled by satellite-configuration (default to 48 hours)
 * On receiving the reset-URL, look up the requested token in the new table
   * if is-valid, send user directly to "change your password" page
   * otherwise, inform them that the link is invalid, and send them to 'forget my password' page to request a new link
 * Once password has been reset:
   * user has a logged-in session
   * confirmation email sent to email-address on file
## Technical Details

### Table





|  column    |  type                  |  default  |  nullable?  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  user_id   |  FK to WEB_CONTACT.ID  |  N/A      |  NO         |
|  token     |  VARCHAR(64)           |  N/A      |  NO         |
|  created   |  TIMESTAMP             |  now      |  NO         |
|  is_valid  |  BOOLEAN               |  T        |  NO         |

Index on user_id and on token

## Stretch Goals



Even the one-time-use link can be abused, if we assume (as we should) that email is an insecure delivery method. 

One possible way to provide actually-secure-communications, would be for the reset-form(s) to allow an optional "recipient's public GPG key" field. If provided, the email-body could be encrypted prior to sending.

Many (most?) users would never use this - it's too inconvenient. Those that would want it, would want it A LOT (think goverment/banking/healthcare).

See if we can fit this option into the feature at some point.
