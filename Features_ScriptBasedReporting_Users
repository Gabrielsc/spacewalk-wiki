= Basic FISMA Report: user report =

User reports were created based on the following requirements:

 1. List all users
 2. Username, Full Name, Position, User type?, email, roles (pipe/semi-colon deliminated?), creation date, last-login date, active state
 3. Optionally list usernames associated to channels and systems? Would that even be sensible?

2009-11-18: spacewalk-backend 0.7.14-1 contains "users" and "users-systems" reports.

Report fields:

{{{
# spacewalk-report --info users --list --info
Users in the system

    List of all users for all organizations, with their details
    and roles.

Fields in the report:

    organization_id: Organization identifier
    organization: Organization name
    user_id: Internal user id
    username: User name / login
    last_name: Last name
    first_name: First name(s)
    position: Position of the user
    email: Email address
    role: Roles assigned to the user
    creation_time: Date and time when the user was created
    last_login_time: When the user last accessed the system
    active: String enabled or disabled
}}}

Note that there are two additional columns identifying the organization, and the user type is not present because the User Type field is basically list of roles in older Satellites, and empty in 5.1+.

{{{
# spacewalk-report --info users-systems --list --info
Systems administered by individual users

    List of systems that users can administer.

Fields in the report:

    organization_id: Organization identifier
    user_id: Internal user id
    username: User name / login
    server_id: System identifier
    group: Group through the user has access to the system
    admin_access: 1 if the user has access by being org administrator
}}}

The output:

{{{
# spacewalk-report users | grep '^25,'
