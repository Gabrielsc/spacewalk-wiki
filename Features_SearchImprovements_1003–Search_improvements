Main Flow / Description
 * Search for errata, filtering by the various identified types.
 * Apply the filtered results to selected systems.
 * Event history is not filterable. There is a deep desire to be able to filter based on results. E.g. Show me only failed actions on a system or set of systems. Which packages failed to install?
 * Extend “filter by synopsis” to all listings of errata, to include errata information for a specific system.
 * The final bugzilla surrounds gleaning information about updating systems, both singly and as a group.
