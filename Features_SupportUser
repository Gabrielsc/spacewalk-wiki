= Support User =
=== REVIEWED BY: ===

== Overview ==
Support for users with read-only access has been a common request of Satellite customers. After several customer discussions we found that this requirement more often than not boils down to a desire for a support user who can log in and perform some simple searches on systems, users, and organizations. As such we decided to pursue this path by implementing a new tab in the satellite UI exposing a simple search interface to users who have the appropriate role.

== Requirements ==
 1. A new user role that corresponds to the support user role.
  * A user may be assigned to the support user role in the same way as any other role is assigned. The role may be assigned in conjunction with other roles as well. For example, a channel administrator may be granted the support user role in order to be able to access the support user specific functionality (searching, auditing, etc.)
  * Permissions to assign the support user role to a user:
   * Satellite/Spacewalk admin can give to anyone.
   * Org admins can give to users in their org.
 1. Users in the support user role have access to new search functionality for their needs.
   * Support user searches must be able to search across all organizations their home org trusts.
    * The user must be able to select a subset of these organizations at the time of search (potential to add saved/named subsets in the future)
   * For initial release this interface will allow only for searching of '''systems''' by:
    * Hostname
    * System ID
    * Custom Field
    * Package Installed
   * Search results must provide a link to existing SDC pages.
    * In the case that the user would not normally have access to the system (i.e. the system is not part of the user's assigned system groups), the SDC pages will be rendered as read only.
   * Search results will indicate the following as a summary of systems that match.
    * Status
    * System Name
    * Organization
 1. New support user searching functionality will be provided through the XMLRPC API layer.
  * The ability to indicate org boundaries for the search must be supported.
  * Each of the search criteria above must be supported.
  * The return of these search APIs should match what is returned for existing search APIs.

== Other Feature Impact ==
Existing APIs check for the existence of a particular role, so there won't be a need to revisit all of the existing APIs to prevent the support user role from having access. New APIs will be added according to the requirements above, which means the addition of QA unit tests as well.

There may be need to enhance the search server's abilities, depending on the final decision on what sort of searches are supported. See the table below for more information on what is currently supported by the search server.

== Proposed Implementation ==
The implementation focuses around creating a new "Support User" role and an associated new section of the UI specifically for its tasks. The APIs will also be added to support the new features, utilizing existing APIs where applicable (i.e. addRole v. assignSupportUserRole).

=== Support User Role ===
 1. Add support user role to the database (rhnUserGroupType)
  * Upgrade script
  * Add to new DB installation scripts
 1. Add support user role to user details screen.
  * Satellite/Spacewalk admin can give to anyone.
  * Org admins can give to users in their org.

=== Support User Tab ===
 1. Add a new top level tab (same level as Overview, Systems, etc.) for users with the support user role (similar to how the Admin tab only appears for the satellite admin). The tab text will read "Support Tools" (jdob - This was taken from a tab in hosted that provides similar functionality, though I'm not 100% in love with the name)
 1. Left navigation while on this tab will (for now) only have an entry for "Search Systems".
  * This entry leads to the System Search Page described below.

=== System Search Page ===
 1. The system search page will follow the model in the current Systems > Advanced Search page (/rhn/systems/Search.do). The page will display the following sections:
  * Search For - Text field allowing the user to enter the search criteria values
  * Field to Search - Drop-down providing the following options:
   * Hostname
   * System ID
   * Custom Field
   * Package Installed
  * Where to Search - The user selects one of two options. These options will be presented similar to the Channels > Package Search page (/rhn/channels/software/Search.do).
   * All Trusted Organizations (default)
   * Specific Organizations - The user will be able to select one or more trusted organizations (similar to the specific architecture selection in Package Search)

=== Read Only Functionality ===
 1. Existing functionality available to user with no roles should be audited to ensure we're comfortable with it being available to a user with the Support role.
  * Currently a user without roles can just register systems, and view channels / errata / scheduled actions in their home org.

=== APIs ===
 1. Create support user API handler offering the same functionality as is available in the UI.
  * Lay the groundwork for community involvement in expanding future support user searches.
  * 

=== Search Server ===
Below is a listing of the different types of searching proposed for the support user and if they are '''currently''' (as of Spacewalk 0.6) supported in the search server. A star indicates the criteria should be available in this iteration.

APIs
|| '''Description''' || '''Estimate''' || '''Confidence''' ||
|| Add API for support user search || ?? || ?? ||
|| Verify existing APIs do not allow support users to do bad things || ?? || ?? ||

Read Only Features
|| Investigate abilities of no-role user || ?? || ?? ||
|| Changes to support read only nature of no-role user || ?? || ?? ||

== Test Notes ==
High level testing areas:
 * Ability to create support users and see the appropriate support user UI functionality
 * Support user searching works correctly
 * Support user only has read only access (potentially tricky due to the scope of what needs to be investigated)
 * New support user APIs work correctly
 * Existing APIs do not allow non-read only functionality to support user

== Risks/Concerns ==
 * Pretty extensive testing required to ensure read only user is actually read only.
 * Could be tricky to figure out how to test the APIs to make sure the support user is not allowed to make changes. Will have to touch base with Brad to see how comfortable he is with our current role support in the APIs.
