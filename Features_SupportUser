= Support User =
=== REVIEWED BY: ===

== Overview ==
Support for users with read-only access has been a common request of Satellite customers. After several customer discussions we found that this requirement more often than not boils down to a desire for a support user who can log in and perform some simple searches on systems, users, and organizations. As such we decided to pursue this path by implementing a new tab in the satellite UI exposing a simple search interface to users who have the appropriate role.

The support user's features can be looked as having two aspects:
 * Read only (or very limited) functionality to change the state of the satellite server
 * Advanced searching/auditing mechanism for systems spanning multiple organizations

== Requirements ==

== Other Feature Impact ==
This will likely need to be addressed in APIs. See the API section below for more details.

There may be need to enhance the search server's abilities, depending on the final decision on what sort of searches are supported.

== Proposed Implementation ==
The implementation focuses around creating a new "Support User" role and an associated new section of the UI specifically for its tasks. The APIs will also be added to support the new features, utilizing existing APIs where applicable (i.e. addRole v. assignSupportUserRole).

=== Support User Role ===
 1. Support users can search across multiple organizations.
  1. By default when created or given the support role, users will see all orgs their home org trusts. (trusts are a feature planned for the second phase of multi-org support)
  1. Create a new UI screen to allow limiting to a selected '''subset''' of the trusted orgs.
  1. Removal of an org trust must result in removal of the org from any configured subsets. (jdob - Does "configured subsets" mean named/saved subsets? This should be a more prominent point if this is the case)
 1. Support role can be given out by org admins to users in their org.

=== Support User UI ===
 1. Support tab will link to a simple search interface.
  * For initial release this interface will allow only for searching of '''systems''' by:
   * Hostname
   * System ID
   * Custom Field
   * Package Installed
  * Search results will link to existing SDC pages but with all submit buttons disabled. Must be careful here to not expose actions that shouldn't be available.
  * Other entities to be searched will be added in future releases.

=== Read Only Functionality ===
 1. Existing functionality available to user with no roles should be audited to ensure we're comfortable with it being available to a user with the Support role.
  * Currently a user without roles can just register systems, and view channels / errata / scheduled actions in their home org.

=== APIs ===
 1. Create support user API handler offering the same functionality as is available in the UI.
  * Lay the groundwork for community involvement in expanding future support user searches.
  * Must ensure support users cannot utilize existing API calls.

=== Search Server ===
Below is a listing of the different types of searching proposed for the support user and if they are '''currently''' (as of Spacewalk 0.6) supported in the search server. A star indicates the criteria should be available in this iteration.

||   || Type of Search ||Search Criteria || Supported in Search-Server || Comments ||
|| * ||Systems || hostname || yes || ||
|| * ||Systems || system id || yes || ||
|| * ||Systems || custom info || yes || ||
||   ||Systems || running kernel || yes || ||
|| * ||Systems || package installed || yes || ||
||   ||Systems || last checkin || yes || ||
||   ||Errata || CVE ID  || yes || ||
||   ||Errata || RHBA/RHSA/RHEA ID || yes ||
||   ||Errata || Package Name || yes || ||
||   ||Errata || Issue Date || yes || ||
||   ||Errata || Severity (Bug | Enhancement | Security (Critical, Moderate, Important) || no || ||
||   ||Software Channels || * || no || ||

== Tasks ==

Confidence: Values 1-5, where 1 is very unsure of the estimate and 5 is extremely confident it will be met.

|| Description || Estimate || Confidence ||
|| Add support user role to database || 1h || 5 ||
|| Make support user role available to UI || 4h || 4 ||

Work in progress:
|| Add support tab to UI header || ?? || ?? ||
|| Support tab UI search page || ?? || ?? ||
|| Search implementation || ?? || ?? ||
|| Search results page || ?? || ?? ||

|| Add API for support user search || ?? || ?? ||
|| Verify existing APIs do not allow support users to do bad things || ?? || ?? ||

|| Investigate abilities of no-role user || ?? || ?? ||
|| Changes to support read only nature of no-role user || ?? || ?? ||

== Test Notes ==
High level testing areas:
 * Ability to create support users and see the appropriate support user UI functionality
 * Support user searching works correctly
 * Support user only has read only access (potentially tricky due to the scope of what needs to be investigated)
 * New support user APIs work correctly
 * Existing APIs do not allow non-read only functionality to support user

== Risks/Concerns ==
 * Pretty extensive testing required to ensure read only user is actually read only
