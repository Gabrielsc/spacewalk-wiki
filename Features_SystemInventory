== Overview ==

This feature refers to our ability to correctly identify the operating system, version, and virtualization capabilities/status of hosts registered to Spacewalk. 

== Requirements ==

 1. Identify the following operating systems and versions:
  1. Red Hat Enterprise Linux: 4 (AS, ES, ...), 5 (Server, Desktop)
  1. Fedora (10+)
  1. CentOS (4, 5)
  1. Solaris (all currently supported versions TBD)
  1. "Unknown" system (for everything we can't identify)
 1. System architecture: x86, x86_64, ppc, s390x, etc.
 1. Virtualization Status
  1. Virtualized guest (Xen, KVM, VMware)
  1. Virtualization capable host (Xen full/para-virt, KVM full-virt)
 1. Ability to update taxonomy. (needs clarification)
 1. System should report basic information for what it thinks it is and not just what we say it is (whether through attribute editing or channel association). 
  * ''Do we want the system reporting what it thinks it is, or the client code dumping us a variety of data and determining what it is server side? This feels like something that should happen on the server to me, we get as much information as possible from the client and then the client side code can hopefully remain relatively stable.'' - dgoodwin

== Other Feature Impact ==

TBD

== Proposed Implementation ==

  1. Client Tools
    1. Modify rhnreg to supply additional information that may be needed. Ideally we'll dump as much data to the server as we can, and the server will determine how to classify the system during registration.
  1. Database
    1. Design schema changes to effectively store the taxonomy information in a format that can remain consistent despite future changes.
    1. How do we populate for existing systems? During upgrade? Occasionally re-attempting to classify systems that are unknown?
  1. Backend
    1. Modify backend code that handles registration to do the classification based on rules.
    1. Need method to update rules easily... TBD
  1. Web UI
    1. Display taxonomy information prominently in web UI, allow for searching/filtering.
    1. Should administrator be able to manually specify taxonomy changes?

Mockups?

Break down the work items probably in a table structure. Is there webui work? what about cli? database? etc.
