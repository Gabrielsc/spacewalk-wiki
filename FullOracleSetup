=== Client ===

You will also need the Oracle Instant Client: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxsoft-082809.html i386] or [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html x86_64] version. Download the following two rpms (where ARCH is either i386 or x86_64):

 * oracle-instantclient11.2-basic-11.2.0.2.0.ARCH.rpm
 * oracle-instantclient11.2-sqlplus-11.2.0.2.0.ARCH.rpm

Do '''NOT''' use oracle-xe-client.

=== Oracle !InstantClient ===

{{{
# yum -y localinstall --nogpgcheck oracle-instantclient11.2-basic*.rpm oracle-instantclient11.2-sqlplus*.rpm
}}}

  * '''WARNING:''' Don't run {{{oracle_env.sh}}} (or {{{oracle_env.csh}}}) in your root environment settings. Instantclient stuff works fine without it. It's usefull only for commandline XE server management under {{{oracle}}} user. 

=== Server Data ===

you should get from your DBA for example this, I will refer to these values in the underneath configs:
 * db_host=oraclehost
 * db_user=spacewalkdbuser
 * db_password=spacewalkdbpassword
 * db_name=spacewalkdb
 * db_port=1521

make sure that you connect to it from your spacewalk machine (open the correct ports on the firewall in between for example!)
simple test:
{{{
telnet oraclehost 1521 
}}}

should at least work.

create tnsnames.ora:
 * for i386 under /usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client/lib/network/admin
 * for x86_64 under /usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib/network/admin

the contents of this file:
{{{
ORACLEHOST=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=oraclehost)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=spacewalkdb)(SERVER=DEDICATED)))
}}}

tnsnames.ora is something similar to a hosts file for your oracle, it maps the name 'spacewalkdb' to the specified oraclehost+port so your oracle can use the 'spacewalkdb' to refer to the database server and correct database.

now you can test the connection:

{{{
# sqlplus spacewalkdbuser/spacewalkdbpassword@spacewalkdb
}}}

if this works you are ready to go configure your spacewalk server.
