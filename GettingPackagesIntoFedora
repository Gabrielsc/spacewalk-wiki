= Phase 1 = 
The first phase will be to get the easy packages into Fedora/EPEL via a quick review.  The easiest method is probably to start with the Perl Modules.  I (stahnma) will try to contact the Perl SIG so they can hopefully get them reviewed rather quickly.  There are certainly some of the perl packages that will need to have the RPM spec file completely changed.  

We can update the list of packages here and provide bugzilla numbers.

== Questions ==
 * Some packages, I am not sure if the perl ones are in this list, are not in installating into proper locations.  Just an FYI, nothing should be in /home/*, /usr/local/*, /opt/* or /srv/*.  There is some clean up to do here.  Would moving these items break items?
 * Also, some versions of packages may vary between the spacewalk repo and what is currently in Fedora.  Can we begin testing with the version in Fedora?
 * What is the furthest back for compatibility we need to worry about? Is Enterprise Linux 4 the earliest?
