= Spacewalk Installation Instructions =

These are installation instruction for Spacewalk 1.0.

Spacewalk 0.8 installation instructions are available at [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/HowToInstall08 HowToInstall08]

----

== Prerequisites ==

 * Outbound open ports 80, 443, 4545 (only if you want to enable monitoring)
 * Inbound open ports 80, 443, 5222 (only if you want to push actions to client machines) and 5269 (only for push actions to a Spacewalk Proxy)
 * Storage for database: 128KB per client system + 64MB per channel
 * Storage for packages (default /var/satellite): Depends on what you're storing; Red Hat recommend 6GB per channel for their channels
 * 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended
 * If you use LDAP as a central identity service and wish to pull user and group information from it, see [wiki:SpacewalkWithLDAP]

= Setting up Spacewalk repo =

RPM downloads of the project are available through a yum repository

  * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/ - Binary RPMs
  * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/source/ - Source RPMs and tarballs

To use this repository install spacewalk-repo with commands below:

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/1.0/RHEL/5/i386/spacewalk-repo-1.0-2.el5.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== Fedora 11 ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/1.0/Fedora/11/i386/spacewalk-repo-1.0-2.fc11.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== Fedora 12 ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/1.0/Fedora/12/i386/spacewalk-repo-1.0-2.fc11.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== Nightly builds ===

If you want to use the nightly builds, add a .repo file pointing to the nightly repository:

{{{
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/spacewalk.repo << 'EOF'
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
# RHEL 5 / CentOS 5
baseurl=http://miroslav.suchy.cz/spacewalk/nightly-candidate/$basearch/os/
# Fedora 12
#baseurl=http://miroslav.suchy.cz/spacewalk/nightly-candidate-f12/$basearch/os
# Fedora 11
#baseurl=http://miroslav.suchy.cz/spacewalk/nightly-candidate-f11/$basearch/os
gpgkey=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF
}}}

'''NOTE:''' Nigthly repo contains developers snapshot and is not suitable in production environment.

= Additional repos & packages =

=== Fedora ===

For Spacewalk on Fedora, a couple of additional dependencies are needed from jpackage. Please create the following yum repository before beginning your Spacewalk installation:

{{{
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/jpackage.repo << EOF
[jpackage]
name=jpackage-f10
baseurl=http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/jpackage/6.0/fedora-10/free/
gpgkey=http://www.jpackage.org/jpackage.asc
gpgcheck=1
EOF
}}}

Note: the dirs for f11 and f12 do not contain the rpms yet

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ===

Spacewalk requires a Java Virtual Machine with version 1.6.0 or greater.  [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL EPEL - Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux] contains a version of the openjdk that works with Spacewalk.  Other dependencies can get installed from EPEL as well.
To get packages from EPEL just install this RPM:

{{{
BASEARCH=$(uname -i)
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/$BASEARCH/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
}}}

Please make sure you have only one java version installed. 
Otherwise you get error messeges like :
 * " bad major version at off set=6" or 
 * "INFO: validateJarFile(/usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/rhn/WEB-INF/lib/jspapi.jar) - jar not loaded."

=== CentOS 5 ===

Follow the instructions for '''Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5''' with the additions:
 * Necessary packages rhn-client-tools and rhnlib were removed from CentOS, they can be found in spacewalk-client repo. Setup it by installing spacewalk-client-repo package.
{{{
rpm -Uvh http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/1.0/RHEL/5/i386/spacewalk-client-repo-1.0-2.el5.noarch.rpm
}}}
 *  Import Redhat's RPM GPG key:
{{{
# wget -O /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release http://www.redhat.com/security/37017186.txt
# rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
}}}

= Oracle Pre-Requisites =

In order to get Spacewalk to run you need the Oracle client and an Oracle 10g database server. The easiest way to do this is to install Oracle XE and the Oracle Instant Client. Instructions on how to do this can be found on the [OracleXeSetup Oracle 10g Express Edition Setup] page.

= Installing Spacewalk =

Just ask yum to install the necessary packages. This will pull down and install the set of RPMs required to get Spacewalk to run.

'''0.8 installation:'''

If you tend to use the Oracle backend:
{{{
yum install spacewalk-oracle 
}}}

If you prefer the PostgreSQL backend:
{{{
yum install spacewalk-postgresql 
}}}

'''Note:''' PostgreSQL support is in early development stage. You may want to take a look at the [PostgreSqlProject PostgreSql Project] page for further information.

= Configuring Spacewalk =

'''Note''': Your Spacewalk server should have a resolvable FQDN such as 'hostname.domain.com'.  If the installer complains that the hostname is not the FQDN, do not use the --skip-fqdn-test flag to skip !  

Also, this will not work unless the spacewalk account has a password.  You can set up a password by logging in to sqlplus with the sys account and using the command 

{{{
PASSWORD user_name
}}}

where user_name = spacewalk.

Once the Spacewalk RPM is installed you need to configure the application, you can run:

{{{
spacewalk-setup --disconnected
}}}



An example session is as follows:

{{{
[root@fjs-0-02 yum.repos.d]# spacewalk-setup --disconnected

=== Configuring Spacewalk with an Answer File  ===
You can also configure spacewalk by using an answer file.  To configure spacewalk by using an answer you just need to run the following
{{{
spacwalk-setup --disconnected --answer-file=<FILENAME>
}}}
An example answer file is as follows
{{{
admin-email = root@localhost
ssl-set-org = Spacewalk Org
ssl-set-org-unit = spacewalk
ssl-set-city = My City
ssl-set-state = My State
ssl-set-country = US
ssl-password = spacewalk
ssl-set-email = root@localhost
ssl-config-sslvhost = Y
db-backend=oracle
db-user=spacewalk
db-password=spacewalk
db-sid=xe
db-host=localhost
db-port=1521
db-protocol=TCP
enable-tftp=Y
}}}
'''NOTE:''' If you do not supply a value or leave out a key you will be prompted to supply that answer

After {{{spacewalk-setup}}} is complete your application is ready to go!
'''Be sure to use the FQDN of the host when you connect.'''

'''NOTE:''' If you notice you missing some buttons and channels that have been created aren't visible in you UI edit {{{/etc/sysconfig/httpd}}} and change:
{{{
export ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle
export NLS_LANG=english.AL32UTF8
}}}
to
{{{
export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server
export NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8
}}}

= Managing Spacewalk =
Spacewalk consists of several services. Each of them has its own init.d script to stop/start/restart. If you want manage all spacewalk services at once use 
{{{
/usr/sbin/rhn-satellite [stop|start|restart].
}}}
