Please note the following exceptions and then refer to the instructions for [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/HowToInstall#RedHatEnterpriseLinux5 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5].

 1. The initial setup using spacewalk-setup --disconnected fails because it is looking for /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release. A symlink to the /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-5 fixes this.

== Oracle Pre-Requisites ==

In order to get Spacewalk to run it needs to point itself at a Oracle 10g database server.  The easiest way todo this is to install Oracle XE.  Instructions on how todo this can be found here:

[OracleXeSetup Oracle XE Setup instructions]

== EPEL Repo setup ==

Spacewalk requires a Java Virtual Machine with version 1.6.0 or greater.  [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL EPEL - Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux] contains a version of the openjdk that works with Spacewalk.  To get packages from EPEL just install this RPM:

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-2.noarch.rpm
}}}
or
{{{
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/x86_64/epel-release-5-2.noarch.rpm
}}}

Please make sure you have only one java version installed. 
Otherwise you get error messeges like :
 * " bad major version at off set=6" or 
 * "INFO: validateJarFile(/usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/rhn/WEB-INF/lib/jspapi.jar) - jar not loaded."

== Installation ==

'''Note''': Your Spacewalk server should have a resolvable FQDN such as 'hostname.domain.com'.  If the installer complains that the hostname is not the FQDN, do not use the --skip-fqdn-test flag to skip !  

RPM downloads of the project are available through a yum repository

  * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum

To use this repository, add a file in {{{yum.repos.d}}} (e.g. {{{/etc/yum.repos.d/spacewalk.repo}}}) with the following contents:

{{{
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.2/rhel/5Server/$basearch/
gpgkey=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
}}}

'''NOTE:''' If you are looking for version 0.1, replace 0.2 with 0.1 in the {{{baseurl}}}.

Then just ask yum to install the application:

{{{
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-former
rpm -e specspo && yum install spacewalk
}}}

This will pull down and install the set of RPMs required to get Spacewalk to run and avoids the conflict with {{{specspo}}}.


'''NOTE:''' x86_64 users will need to add a file {{{/etc/ld.so.conf.d}}} (e.g. {{{/etc/ld.so.conf.d/spacewalk.conf}}}) with the following contents:
{{{
  /usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0.4/client64/lib/
  /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/lib/
}}}
Run {{{ldconfig -v}}} to enable these changes on your system

Once the Spacewalk rpm is installed you need to configure the application, you can run:

{{{
spacewalk-setup --disconnected
}}}



An example session is as follows:

{{{
[root@fjs-0-11 tmp]# spacewalk-setup --disconnected

If you are on x86_64 and tomcat5 fails to restart you need todo a:

{{{
 cd /var/lib/tomcat5/webapps/rhn/WEB-INF/lib && rm ojdbc14.jar && ln -s /usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0/client64/lib/ojdbc14.jar ojdbc14.jar;
}}}

After {{{spacewalk-setup}}} is complete your application is ready to go!
'''Be sure to use the FQDN of the host when you connect.'''

 * During spacewalk-setup, you will be prompted for a satellite certificate, if you do not already have access to one you can generate one by following CertCreation.
