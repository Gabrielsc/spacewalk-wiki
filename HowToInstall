'''NOTE:''' Nigthly repo contains developers snapshot and is not suitable in production environment.

== Additional repos & packages ==

=== Jpackage repository ===

==== RHEL 6 and Fedora 14 & 15 ====

For Spacewalk on RHEL 6 and Fedora, a couple of additional dependencies are needed from jpackage. Please configure the following yum repository before beginning your Spacewalk installation:

{{{
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/jpackage-generic.repo << EOF
[jpackage-generic]
name=JPackage generic
baseurl=http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/jpackage/5.0/generic/free/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://www.jpackage.org/jpackage.asc
EOF
}}}

We specifically want 5.0 generic directory in the above URL.
Make sure, you do not use the jpackage-generic repository on RHEL 5.

=== EPEL repository ===

Spacewalk requires a Java Virtual Machine with version 1.6.0 or greater.  [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL EPEL - Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux] contains a version of the openjdk that works with Spacewalk.  Other dependencies can get installed from EPEL as well.
To get packages from EPEL just install this RPM:

==== EPEL 5 (use for RHEL 5) ====
{{{
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
}}}

==== EPEL 6 (use for RHEL 6) ====
{{{
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm
}}}

Please make sure you have only one java version installed. 
Otherwise you get error messeges like :
 * " bad major version at off set=6" or 
 * "INFO: validateJarFile(/usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/rhn/WEB-INF/lib/jspapi.jar) - jar not loaded."

When using RHEL 6, make sure you are subscribed to following channels as well:
 * '''Red Hat High Availability Server 6'''
 * '''Red Hat Optional Server 6'''

=== CentOS 5 ===

Follow the instructions to use '''EPEL 5''' with the additions:
 * Necessary packages rhn-client-tools and rhnlib were removed from CentOS, they can be found in spacewalk-client repo. Setup it by installing spacewalk-client-repo package.
{{{
rpm -ihv http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/1.5-client/RHEL/5/x86_64/spacewalk-client-repo-1.5-1.el5.noarch.rpm
}}}
 *  Import Redhat's RPM GPG key:
{{{
# wget -O /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release http://www.redhat.com/security/37017186.txt
# rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
}}}

== Oracle Pre-Requisites ==

In order to get Spacewalk to run with Oracle database backend, you need:
 * the Oracle Instant Client
 * an oracle database, this can either be:
  * Oracle 10g or 11g database server see the [Full oracle Setup] page. (we assume here you use a seperate host running oracle)
  * the free alternative Oracle XE. Instructions on how to do this can be found on the [OracleXeSetup Oracle 10g Express Edition Setup] page.

== PostgreSQL Pre-Requisites ==

In order to get Spacewalk ro run with PostgreSQL database backend, you need PostgreSQL 8.4 server installed on the same or different machine. Use [wiki:PostgreSQLServerSetup] as a guide to get the server installed and setup.

Please note that the functionality of Spacewalk on PostgreSQL is limited and sooner than later you may hit Internal Server Error.

== Conflicting Packages ==
There is an open [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=593402 bug 593402] that identifies the package cobbler-web as conflicting with Spacewalk's Taskomatic process. Until the issue is addressed, it is recommended that the cobbler-web package be removed from the Spacewalk server.
{{{
yum remove cobbler-web
}}}

Yum can also be configured to exclude that package in the future by adding the following entry to the [main] section in /etc/yum.conf:
{{{
vi /etc/yum.conf

[main]
....
exclude=cobbler-web
}}}

There is a workaround to be able to install cobbler-web and use it alongside Spacewalk.  Instructions can be found at CobblerWebWorkaround.

== Installing Spacewalk ==

Just ask yum to install the necessary packages. This will pull down and install the set of RPMs required to get Spacewalk to run.

If you tend to use the Oracle backend:
{{{
yum install spacewalk-oracle 
}}}

If you prefer the PostgreSQL backend:
{{{
yum install spacewalk-postgresql 
}}}

You may want to take a look at the [wiki:PostgreSQL] page for further information about the PostgreSQL backend.

== Configuring the firewall ==

Spacewalk needs various inbound ports to be connectible. Assuming you have a default RHEL/CentOS set up, proceed as following:

For RHEL 5/CentOS 5/Scientific Linux 5
{{{
iptables -D RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
service iptables save
service iptables restart
}}}

For RHEL 6/Scientific Linux 6
{{{
iptables -D INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
service iptables save
service iptables restart
}}}


Add port 5222 if you want to push actions to client machines and 5269 for push actions to a Spacewalk Proxy, 69 udp if you want to use tftp.


== Configuring Spacewalk ==

Your Spacewalk server should have a resolvable FQDN such as 'hostname.domain.com'.  If the installer complains that the hostname is not the FQDN, do not use the --skip-fqdn-test flag to skip !  

The setup requires that the database account has a password.[[BR]]
'''Note:''' Please don't use ''' '#' ''' (number sign/pound/hash) and ''' '@' ''' in your database password otherwise installation will fail.

Once the Spacewalk RPM is installed you need to configure the application, you can run:

{{{
spacewalk-setup --disconnected
}}}



An example session is as follows:

{{{
# spacewalk-setup --disconnected

=== Configuring Spacewalk with an Answer File  ===

You can also configure Spacewalk by using an answer file, by running {{{spacewalk-setup}}} like

{{{
spacewalk-setup --disconnected --answer-file=<FILENAME>
}}}

An example answer file for the Oracle database backend:

{{{
admin-email = root@localhost
ssl-set-org = Spacewalk Org
ssl-set-org-unit = spacewalk
ssl-set-city = My City
ssl-set-state = My State
ssl-set-country = US
ssl-password = spacewalk
ssl-set-email = root@localhost
ssl-config-sslvhost = Y
db-backend=oracle
db-user=spacewalk
db-password=spacewalk
db-name=xe
db-host=localhost
db-port=1521
enable-tftp=Y
}}}

If you do not supply a value or leave out a key you will be prompted to supply that answer.

For PostgreSQL, you need to create something like this:

{{{
admin-email = root@localhost
ssl-set-org = Spacewalk Org
ssl-set-org-unit = spacewalk
ssl-set-city = My City
ssl-set-state = My State
ssl-set-country = US
ssl-password = spacewalk
ssl-set-email = root@localhost
ssl-config-sslvhost = Y
db-backend=postgresql
db-name=spaceschema
db-user=spaceuser
db-password=spacepw
db-host=host
db-port=5432
enable-tftp=Y
}}}

After {{{spacewalk-setup}}} is complete your application is ready to go!

Once you've made sure you can login to the Spacewalk WebUI, you can then proceed to the next step: [UploadFedoraContent Uploading Content].

== Managing Spacewalk ==

Spacewalk consists of several services. Each of them has its own init.d script to stop/start/restart. If you want manage all spacewalk services at once use 
{{{
/usr/sbin/spacewalk-service [stop|start|restart].
}}}

== Known Issues ==
