 * [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/HowToInstall#RedHatEnterpriseLinux5 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5]
 * [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/HowToInstall#CentOS5 CentOS 5]
 * [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/HowToInstall#Fedora10 Fedora 10]

== Prerequisites ==

 * Outbound open ports 80, 443, 4545 (only if you want to enable monitoring)
 * Inbound open ports 80, 443, 5222 (only if you want to push actions to client machines) and 5269 (only for push actions to a Spacewalk Proxy)
 * Storage for database: 128KB per client system + 64MB per channel
 * Storage for packages (default /var/satellite): Depends on what you're storing; Red Hat recommend 6GB per channel for their channels

= CentOS 5 =

Please note the following exceptions and then refer to the instructions for [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/HowToInstall#RedHatEnterpriseLinux5 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5].
 1. You will need rhel-instnum which is packaged and provided by stahnma's client tools repo for CentOS. Switch to x86_64 if you are using that arch. 
{{{ 
rpm -Uvh http://stahnma.fedorapeople.org/spacewalk-tools/5/i386/spacewalk-client-tools-0.0-1.noarch.rpm 
}}} 
 1.  You will need Redhat's RPM GPG key:
{{{
# wget -O /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release http://www.redhat.com/security/37017186.txt
# rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
}}}

= Fedora 10 =

For Spacewalk 0.5 a couple additional dependencies are needed from jpackage. Please create the following yum repository before beginning your Spacewalk installation:

{{{
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/jpackage.repo << EOF
[jpackage]
name=jpackage-f10
baseurl=http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/jpackage/6.0/fedora-10/free/
gpgkey=http://www.jpackage.org/jpackage.asc
gpgcheck=1
EOF
}}}

Note that Fedora 10 does not require the EPEL repositories.

= Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 =

== Oracle Pre-Requisites ==

In order to get Spacewalk to run it needs to point itself at a Oracle 10g database server.  The easiest way todo this is to install Oracle XE.  Instructions on how todo this can be found on the [OracleXeSetup Oracle 10g Express Edition Setup] page.

== EPEL Repo setup ==

'''NOTE:''' Not required for Fedora.

Spacewalk requires a Java Virtual Machine with version 1.6.0 or greater.  [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL EPEL - Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux] contains a version of the openjdk that works with Spacewalk.  To get packages from EPEL just install this RPM:

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-2.noarch.rpm
}}}
or
{{{
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/x86_64/epel-release-5-2.noarch.rpm
}}}

Please make sure you have only one java version installed. 
Otherwise you get error messeges like :
 * " bad major version at off set=6" or 
 * "INFO: validateJarFile(/usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/rhn/WEB-INF/lib/jspapi.jar) - jar not loaded."

You must also edit /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-testing.repo and change enabled=1. EPEL testing is currently required for Spacewalk 0.5.


== Installation ==

'''Note''': Your Spacewalk server should have a resolvable FQDN such as 'hostname.domain.com'.  If the installer complains that the hostname is not the FQDN, do not use the --skip-fqdn-test flag to skip !  

RPM downloads of the project are available through a yum repository

  * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum - Binary RPMs
  * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/source - Source RPMs and tarballs

To use this repository either install spacewalk-repo RPM

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.4/rhel/5Server/i386/spacewalk-repo-0.4-1.el5.noarch.rpm

}}}
add a file in {{{yum.repos.d}}} (e.g. {{{/etc/yum.repos.d/spacewalk.repo}}}) with the following contents:
=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux ===
{{{
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.5/RHEL/5/$basearch/os/
gpgkey=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
}}}

=== Fedora ===
{{{
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.5/Fedora/10/$basearch/os/
gpgkey=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
}}}

'''NOTE:''' If you are looking for versions 0.4 replace 0.5 with appropriate version in the {{{baseurl}}}.

If you want to use the nightly builds, use the following config:

{{{
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://miroslav.suchy.cz/spacewalk/nightly-candidate/i386/os/
gpgkey=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
}}}

Note that Fedora 10 devel repo is at:

{{{ 
http://miroslav.suchy.cz/spacewalk/nightly-candidate-f10/
}}}

Then just ask yum to install the application:

{{{
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-former
yum install gpg
yum install spacewalk
}}}

This will pull down and install the set of RPMs required to get Spacewalk to run. Once the Spacewalk RPM is installed you need to configure the application, you can run:

{{{
spacewalk-setup --disconnected
}}}



An example session is as follows:

{{{
[root@fjs-0-11 tmp]# spacewalk-setup --disconnected

If you are on x86_64 and tomcat5 fails to restart you need todo a:

{{{
cd /var/lib/tomcat5/webapps/rhn/WEB-INF/lib &&\
   rm ojdbc14.jar &&\
   ln -s /usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0.4/client64/lib/ojdbc14.jar ojdbc14.jar;
}}}

After {{{spacewalk-setup}}} is complete your application is ready to go!
'''Be sure to use the FQDN of the host when you connect.'''

Once you've made sure you can login to the Spacewalk web UI, you can then proceed to the next step: [UploadFedoraContent Uploading Content].

== Starting Spacewalk ==
If you are installing spacewalk 0.3 and later you should be using /usr/sbin/rhn-satellite to stop/start/restart the spacewalk server as the init.d script has been removed.
