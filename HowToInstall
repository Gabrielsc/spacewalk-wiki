= Intro =

The below instructions are how to install Spacewalk into a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 server.  Future versions will include instructions and support for Fedora and other Linux variants.

= Oracle Pre-Requisites =

In order to get Spacewalk to run it needs to point itself at a Oracle 10g database server.  The easiest way todo this is to install Oracle XE.  Instructions on how todo this can be found here:

[OracleXeSetup Oracle XE Setup instructions]

= EPEL Repo setup =
You need to be registered to hosted to make use of the EPEL repo

Spacewalk requires a Java Virtual Machine with version 1.5.0 or greater.  [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL EPEL - Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux] contains a version of the openjdk that works with spacewalk.  To get packages from EPEL just install this RPM:

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-2.noarch.rpm
}}}


= Installation =

RPM downloads of the project are available through a yum repository

  * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum

To use this repository, add a file in yum.repos.d with the following contents:

{{{
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/rhel/$releasever/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
}}}

Then just ask yum to install the application:

{{{
yum install spacewalk
}}}

This will pull down and install the set of RPMs required to get spacewalk to run.  You may get a conflict from '''rhns''' with specspo.  If so, just do a:

{{{
rpm -e specspo && yum install spacewalk
}}}

Once the spacewalk rpm is installed you need to configure the application.  Todo this run:

{{{
spacewalk-setup --disconnected
}}}

This will prompt you for questions about your database configuration and spacewalk certificate location.

An example session is as follows:

{{{
TBD
}}}

After spacewalk-configure is complete your application is ready to go!

You can also find source RPMs and tarballs at the following URL:
   * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/source

= Current set of TODO/potholes =

Need these 2 environment variables:

{{{
# export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/
# export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/bin/
}}}


You may need to disable selinux if you encounter this error:

{{{
Could not connect to the database.  Your connection information may be incorrect.  Error: install_driver(Oracle) failed: Can't load '/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i386-linux-thread-multi/auto/DBD/Oracle/Oracle.so' for module DBD::Oracle: /usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0/client/lib/libnnz10.so: cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied at /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i386-linux-thread-multi/DynaLoader.pm line 230, <STDIN> line 6.

}}}

During spacewalk-setup, you will be prompted for a satellite certificate, if you do not already have access to one you can generate one by following CertCreation.

The dependency for the "concurrent" package is not getting processed properly. Until we can get this dependency right in rhn-java-sat:

{{{
yum install concurrent
}}}
