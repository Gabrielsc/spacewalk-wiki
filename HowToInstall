RPM downloads of the project are available through a yum repository

  * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum

To use this repository, add a file in yum.repos.d with the following contents:

{{{
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/rhel/$releasever/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
}}}

Then just ask yum to install the application:

{{{
yum install spacewalk
}}}

This will pull down and install the set of RPMs required to get spacewalk to run.  You may get a conflict from '''rhns''' with specspo.  If so, just do a:

{{{rpm -e specspo}}}
