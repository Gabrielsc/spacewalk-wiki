== Prerequisites ==

 * Outbound open ports 80, 443, 4545 (only if you want to enable monitoring)
 * Inbound open ports 80, 443, 5222 (only if you want to push actions to client machines) and 5269 (only for push actions to a Spacewalk Proxy)
 * Storage for database: 128KB per client system + 64MB per channel
 * Storage for packages (default /var/satellite): Depends on what you're storing; Red Hat recommend 6GB per channel for their channels
 * 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended
 * If you use LDAP as a central identity service and wish to pull user and group information from it, see [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/SpacewalkWithLDAP]

= Setting up Spacewalk repo =

RPM downloads of the project are available through a yum repository

  * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum - Binary RPMs
  * http://spacewalk.redhat.com/source - Source RPMs and tarballs

To use this repository install spacewalk-repo with commands below:

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.6/RHEL/5/i386/os/Packages/spacewalk-repo-0.6-5.el5.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== Fedora 10 ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.6/Fedora/10/i386/os/Packages/spacewalk-repo-0.6-5.fc10.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== Fedora 11 ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.6/Fedora/11/i386/os/Packages/spacewalk-repo-0.6-5.fc11.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== Nightly builds ===

If you want to use the nightly builds, add a .repo file pointing to the nightly repository:

{{{
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/spacewalk.repo << 'EOF'
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://miroslav.suchy.cz/spacewalk/nightly-candidate/$basearch/os/
gpgkey=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF
}}}

'''NOTE:''' if yum install or update nags about "cobbler >= 1.6.3 is needed by package <bla>" enable the "epel-testing" repo in /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-testing.repo

Fedora 10 nightly repo is at:

{{{ 
http://miroslav.suchy.cz/spacewalk/nightly-candidate-f10/
}}}

Fedora 11 nightly repo is at:

{{{ 
http://miroslav.suchy.cz/spacewalk/nightly-candidate-f11/
}}}

= Additional repos & packages =

=== Fedora 10/11 ===

For Spacewalk 0.5/0.6 a couple of additional dependencies are needed from jpackage. Please create the following yum repository before beginning your Spacewalk installation (Note: F11 is using the f10 jpackage repo intentionally) :

{{{
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/jpackage.repo << EOF
[jpackage]
name=jpackage-f10
baseurl=http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/jpackage/6.0/fedora-10/free/
gpgkey=http://www.jpackage.org/jpackage.asc
gpgcheck=1
EOF
}}}


=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ===

Spacewalk requires a Java Virtual Machine with version 1.6.0 or greater.  [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL EPEL - Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux] contains a version of the openjdk that works with Spacewalk.  To get packages from EPEL just install this RPM:

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
}}}
or
{{{
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/x86_64/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
}}}

Please make sure you have only one java version installed. 
Otherwise you get error messeges like :
 * " bad major version at off set=6" or 
 * "INFO: validateJarFile(/usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/rhn/WEB-INF/lib/jspapi.jar) - jar not loaded."

=== CentOS 5 ===

Follow the instructions for '''Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5''' with the additions:
 1. You will need rhel-instnum which is packaged and provided by stahnma's client tools repo for CentOS. Switch to x86_64 if you are using that arch. 
{{{ 
rpm -Uvh http://stahnma.fedorapeople.org/spacewalk-tools/5/i386/spacewalk-client-tools-0.0-1.noarch.rpm 
}}} 
 1.  You will need Redhat's RPM GPG key:
{{{
# wget -O /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release http://www.redhat.com/security/37017186.txt
# rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
}}}

= Oracle Pre-Requisites =

In order to get Spacewalk to run you need the Oracle client and an Oracle 10g database server. The easiest way to do this is to install Oracle XE and the Oracle Instant Client. Instructions on how to do this can be found on the [OracleXeSetup Oracle 10g Express Edition Setup] page.

= Installing Spacewalk =

Just ask yum to install the application:

{{{
yum install gpg   # not needed for 0.7+, see 28a5a1ef314891a2b212930e64b5c9ca60088fe3
yum install spacewalk
}}}

This will pull down and install the set of RPMs required to get Spacewalk to run.

= Configuring Spacewalk =

'''Note''': Your Spacewalk server should have a resolvable FQDN such as 'hostname.domain.com'.  If the installer complains that the hostname is not the FQDN, do not use the --skip-fqdn-test flag to skip !  

Also, this will not work unless the spacewalk account has a password.  You can set up a password by logging in to sqlplus with the sys account and using the command 

{{{
PASSWORD user_name
}}}

where user_name = spacewalk.

Once the Spacewalk RPM is installed you need to configure the application, you can run:

{{{
spacewalk-setup --disconnected
}}}



An example session is as follows:

{{{
[root@fjs-0-02 yum.repos.d]# spacewalk-setup --disconnected

If you are on x86_64 and tomcat5 fails to restart you need todo a:

{{{
cd /var/lib/tomcat5/webapps/rhn/WEB-INF/lib &&\
   rm ojdbc14.jar &&\
   ln -s /usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0.4/client64/lib/ojdbc14.jar ojdbc14.jar;
}}}

After {{{spacewalk-setup}}} is complete your application is ready to go!
'''Be sure to use the FQDN of the host when you connect.'''

'''NOTE:''' If you notice you missing some buttons and channels that have been created aren't visible in you UI edit {{{/etc/sysconfig/httpd}}} and change:
{{{
export ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle
export NLS_LANG=english.AL32UTF8
}}}
to
{{{
export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server
export NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8
}}}

Once you've made sure you can login to the Spacewalk web UI, you can then proceed to the next step: [UploadFedoraContent Uploading Content].

= Managing Spacewalk =
Spacewalk consists of several services. Each of them has its own init.d script to stop/start/restart. If you want manage all spacewalk services at once use 
{{{
/usr/sbin/rhn-satellite [stop|start|restart].
}}}
