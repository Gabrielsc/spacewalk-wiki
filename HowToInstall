= Spacewalk Installation Instructions =

These are installation instructions for new installations of Spacewalk 1.8. If you are upgrading from older versions, see HowToUpgrade.

Spacewalk 1.7 installation instructions are available at [wiki:HowToInstall17].

----

== Prerequisites ==

 * Outbound open ports 80, 443, 4545 (only if you want to enable monitoring)
 * Inbound open ports 80, 443, 5222 (only if you want to push actions to client machines) and 5269 (only for push actions to a Spacewalk Proxy), 69 udp if you want to use tftp
 * Storage for database: 250 KiB per client system +  500 KiB per channel + 230 KiB per package in channel (i.e. 1.1GiB for channel with 5000 packages)
 * Storage for packages (default /var/satellite): Depends on what you're storing; Red Hat recommend 6GB per channel for their channels
 * 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended
 * Make sure your underlying OS up-to-date.
 * If you use LDAP as a central identity service and wish to pull user and group information from it, see [wiki:SpacewalkWithLDAP]
 * Make sure your operating system is fully up-to-date.

== Setting up Spacewalk repo ==

RPM downloads of the project are available through yum repositories at

  * http://yum.spacewalkproject.org/ - Binary RPMs

To use this repository easily, install spacewalk-repo package with commands below:

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, CentOS 5 ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://yum.spacewalkproject.org/1.8/RHEL/5/x86_64/spacewalk-repo-1.8-4.el5.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Scientific Linux 6, CentOS 6 ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://yum.spacewalkproject.org/1.8/RHEL/6/x86_64/spacewalk-repo-1.8-4.el6.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== Fedora 16 ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://yum.spacewalkproject.org/1.8/RHEL/6/x86_64/spacewalk-repo-1.8-4.fc16.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== Fedora 17 ===

{{{
rpm -Uvh http://yum.spacewalkproject.org/1.8/RHEL/6/x86_64/spacewalk-repo-1.8-4.fc17.noarch.rpm
}}}


=== Nightly builds ===

If you want to use the nightly builds, install the {{{spacewalk-repo}}} package based on your operating system (see above) and then enable the nightly repository:

{{{
sed -i 's/enabled=0/enabled=1/' /etc/yum.repos.d/spacewalk-nightly.repo
sed -i 's/enabled=1/enabled=0/' /etc/yum.repos.d/spacewalk.repo
}}}

'''NOTE:''' Nigthly repo contains developers snapshot and it is not suitable for production environment. Especially beware that you might not be able to upgrade from the nightly installation to the next release, especially with respect to the database schema.

== Additional repos & packages ==

=== Red Hat Optional Server 6 ===

When using RHEL 6, make sure you are subscribed to following RHN channel:

  * '''Red Hat Optional Server 6'''

=== Jpackage repository ===

==== RHEL 6, SL 6, CentOS 6 and Fedora ====

For Spacewalk on EL 6 and Fedora, a couple of additional dependencies are needed from jpackage.
If repo is broken, mirror list here: http://www.jpackage.org/mirroring.php
Please configure the following yum repository before beginning your Spacewalk installation:

{{{
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/jpackage-generic.repo << EOF
[jpackage-generic]
name=JPackage generic
#baseurl=http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/pub/jpackage/5.0/generic/free/
mirrorlist=http://www.jpackage.org/mirrorlist.php?dist=generic&type=free&release=5.0
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://www.jpackage.org/jpackage.asc
EOF
}}}

We specifically want 5.0 generic directory in the above URL.
Make sure, you do not use the jpackage-generic repository on RHEL 5.

=== EPEL repository ===

Spacewalk requires a Java Virtual Machine with version 1.6.0 or greater.  [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL EPEL - Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux] contains a version of the openjdk that works with Spacewalk.  Other dependencies can get installed from EPEL as well.
To get packages from EPEL just install this RPM:

==== EPEL 5 (use for RHEL 5) ====
{{{
rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
}}}

==== EPEL 6 (use for RHEL 6) ====
{{{
rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-7.noarch.rpm
}}}

=== CentOS 5 ===

Follow the instructions to use '''EPEL 5''' with the additions:
 * Necessary packages rhn-client-tools and rhnlib were removed from CentOS, they can be found in spacewalk-client repo. Setup it by installing spacewalk-client-repo package.
{{{
rpm -ihv http://yum.spacewalkproject.org/1.8-client/RHEL/5/x86_64/spacewalk-client-repo-1.8-4.el5.noarch.rpm
}}}
 *  Import Red Hat's RPM GPG key:
{{{
# wget -O /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release http://www.redhat.com/security/37017186.txt
# rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
}}}

== PostgreSQL Pre-Requisites ==

In order to get Spacewalk to run with PostgreSQL database backend, you need PostgreSQL 8.4 server installed on the same or different machine. Use [wiki:PostgreSQLServerSetup] as a guide to get the server installed and setup.

When using external PostgreSQL database, make sure the postgresql-contrib (or postgresql84-contrib on RHEL 5) package is installed on the database server.

== Oracle Pre-Requisites ==

In order to get Spacewalk to run with Oracle database backend, you need:

 * Instant Client 11.2.0.3.0 installed on the Spacewalk machine
 * Oracle database server, either on the Spacewalk machine or on another host; versions 10g and 11g are known to work

Installation of the free but limited Oracle 10g XE database server can be found on the [wiki:OracleXeSetup Oracle 11g Express Edition Setup] page. Hints for making Spacewalk work with external Oracle database server are on the [FullOracleSetup Full Oracle Setup] page.

== Installing Spacewalk ==

Just ask yum to install the necessary packages. This will pull down and install the set of RPMs required to get Spacewalk to run.

If you prefer the [wiki:PostgreSQL] backend:
{{{
yum install spacewalk-postgresql 
}}}

If you tend to use the Oracle backend:
{{{
yum install spacewalk-oracle 
}}}

== Configuring the firewall ==

Spacewalk needs various inbound ports to be connectible. Use {{{system-config-firewall}}} or edit {{{/etc/sysconfig/iptables}}}, adding the ports needed -- 80 and 443. Add port 5222 if you want to push actions to client machines and 5269 for push actions to a Spacewalk Proxy, 69 udp if you want to use tftp.

== Configuring Spacewalk ==

Your Spacewalk server should have a resolvable FQDN such as 'hostname.domain.com'.  If the installer complains that the hostname is not the FQDN, do not use the --skip-fqdn-test flag to skip !  

The setup requires that the database account has a password.[[BR]]
'''Note:''' Please don't use ''' '#' ''' (number sign/pound/hash) and ''' '@' ''' in your database password otherwise installation will fail.

Once the Spacewalk RPM is installed you need to configure the application, you can run:

{{{
spacewalk-setup --disconnected --external-db
}}}



An example session is as follows:

{{{
# spacewalk-setup --disconnected --external-db

Should the spacewalk-setup fail, check the error it gives you and also investigate the logs in /var/log/rhn, as well as the logs from your database server, Apache server and tomcat.

=== Configuring Spacewalk with an Answer File  ===

You can also configure Spacewalk by using an answer file, by running {{{spacewalk-setup}}} like

{{{
spacewalk-setup --disconnected --answer-file=<FILENAME>
}}}

An example answer file for the Oracle database backend:

{{{
admin-email = root@localhost
ssl-set-org = Spacewalk Org
ssl-set-org-unit = spacewalk
ssl-set-city = My City
ssl-set-state = My State
ssl-set-country = US
ssl-password = spacewalk
ssl-set-email = root@localhost
ssl-config-sslvhost = Y
db-backend=oracle
db-user=spacewalk
db-password=spacewalk
db-name=xe
db-host=localhost
db-port=1521
enable-tftp=Y
}}}

If you do not supply a value or leave out a key you will be prompted to supply that answer.

For PostgreSQL, you need to create something like this:

{{{
admin-email = root@localhost
ssl-set-org = Spacewalk Org
ssl-set-org-unit = spacewalk
ssl-set-city = My City
ssl-set-state = My State
ssl-set-country = US
ssl-password = spacewalk
ssl-set-email = root@localhost
ssl-config-sslvhost = Y
db-backend=postgresql
db-name=spaceschema
db-user=spaceuser
db-password=spacepw
db-host=host
db-port=5432
enable-tftp=Y
}}}

After {{{spacewalk-setup}}} is complete your application is ready to go!

Once you've made sure you can login to the Spacewalk WebUI, you can then proceed to the next step: [UploadFedoraContent Uploading Content].

== Managing Spacewalk ==

Spacewalk consists of several services. Each of them has its own init.d script to stop/start/restart. If you want manage all spacewalk services at once use 
{{{
/usr/sbin/spacewalk-service [stop|start|restart].
}}}
