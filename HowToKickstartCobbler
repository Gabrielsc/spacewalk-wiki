== Introducing Spacewalk and Cobbler ==

Version 0.4 of Spacewalk adds significantly enhanced machine kickstarting capabilities due the the advent of tight integration between Spacewalk and the [https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/ Cobbler] installation server system.  Cobbler is in fact now a component of Spacewalk - when you install Spacewalk, Cobbler will be included as a dependency.  

With Cobbler integration, Spacewalk gains some exciting new features:

 * Xen installs now use the virtinst library (same as virt manager)
 * Support for qemu/kvm based virtual machines
 * Support for lvm-backed guest installs
 * Support for virtual machines with multiple disks
 * Support for virtual machines with multiple NICs
 * Increased breadth of operating system support:
	* First-class support for
		* RHEL
		* Fedora
		* CentOS
	* Second-class support (ks templates and PXE only) for
		* Debian / Ubuntu
		* SuSE
 * Additional deployment options:
	* Bare-metal PXE kickstarting is supported
		* Auto-generated and updated menus
		* No longer necessary to install an OS in order to kickstart
 	* LiveCD / DeadCD support for bare metal rollouts where PXE isn't possible
	* Bare-metal kickstarts possible on multiple subnets
 * Integrated DHCP and DNS management
 * Powerful kickstart file templating

== Quick Start Guide ==

Here's a quick guide to get you going with the new goodies:

 1. Create a Distro
     a. In Spacewalk
	1. Create a channel (if you have on set up already, go to the next step)
		a. Select Channels|Manage Software Channels and select "+ create new channel"
		a. Fill in the required fields as described.
		a. Populate the channel with packages using rhnpush
			* e.g. rhnpush --server localhost -u admin -p spacewalk  --channel kstest001 /mnt/Packages/*.rpm
	1. Select Systems|Kickstart|Distributions and select "+ create new distribution"
	1. On the "Create Kickstart Distribution" page, fill in the items as described
     a. In Cobbler
 1. Create a Kickstart Profile
     a. In Spacewalk
     a. In Cobbler
 1. Use Spacewalk to kickstart a system with your profiles
 1. Kickstart a bare-metal machine
 1. Kickstart a virtual machine
	a. In Spacewalk
	a. With koan

== Cobbler Templating Variables, Kernel Options, and how they can help ==

 * How to add variables to Kickstart Distributions, Profiles and Systems in the Spacewalk GUI
 * How to do the same in Cobbler
 * How to use these variables in a kickstart file

== Upload your own Kickstart File ==

 * Discussion of new 'upload' mode of creating a kickstart profile
 * How this differs from the 'wizard' mode, and cobbler implications
 * Moving from 'wizard' mode to the full templating mode
 * Details where these files are stored on the file system

== How Integration Works ==

 * What happens when you create a Distro in the GUI, outline creation in spacewalk DB and XMLRPC calls into cobbler
 * What happens when you create a Profile in the GUI, outline creation in spacewalk DB and XMLRPC calls into cobbler
 * When and why we create cobbler system records. 
 * What happens when the user creates cobbler objects and when they show up in Spacewalk, and where these operations are limited
 * taskomatic's job in syncing changes from spacewalk to cobbler
 * taskomatic's job in syncing changes from cobbler to cobbler

== Cobbler Tips And Tricks ==

 * Cobbler editing of fields in Spacewalk through the cobbler command line
 * PXE features in more depth
   * PXE boot loop prevention and all about BIOS order
 * Virt features in more depth
 * cobbler power management (integration in a future release?)
 * cobbler dhcp/dns management
 * cobbler replicate and it's use in Spacewalk context
 * other cobbler features you might find interesting
