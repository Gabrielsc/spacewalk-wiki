= Spacewalk Upgrade Instructions =

Spacewalk upgrade from version 0.2 to 0.3 involves several basic steps:
  1.  Configuration files and spacewalk database backup
  2.  Package upgrade
  3.  Schema upgrade
  4.  Restart Spacewalk

----


=  Database and configuration backup  =


  *  For existing configuration files, create a backup of everything under /etc/sysconfig/rhn/ and /etc/rhn/
  *  For instructions on how to create a backup of your existing spacewalk database consult either Oracle documentation or contact your DBA


= Package upgrade =

Setup your yum configuration to point to spacewalk 0.3 repo:

{{{
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.3/rhel/5Server/$basearch/
gpgkey=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
}}}

Stop your spacewalk server. To accomplish this, execute following command as root:

{{{
# service rhn-satellite stop
}}}

Perform package upgrade using yum:

{{{
# yum upgrade
}}}


=  Schema upgrade  =

Make sure your spacewalk server is down:

{{{
# service rhn-satellite status
}}}

Make sure your oracle server is running. For oracle-xe that would be:

{{{
# service oracle-xe status
}}}

Run spacewalk-schema-upgrade script to upgrade database schema:

{{{
# /usr/bin/spacewalk-schema-upgrade
}}}


Log files from schema upgrade are being put into /var/log/spacewalk/schema-upgrade


=  Restart spacewalk  =

If all of the above steps completed successfully, you can start your upgraded spacewalk. With Spacewalk 0.3 rhn-satellite init script
was decommissioned and all spacewalk services are being started individually. If you need to restart your spacewalk using one command,
use /sbin/rhn-satellite script.

{{{
# /sbin/rhn-satellite start
}}}


----

What's bellow are additional steps that were required for Spacewalk 0.1 to Spacewalk 0.2 upgrades. These steps are no longer required for
Spacewalk 0.2 to Spacewalk 0.3 upgrades and can be safely ignored.

=  Package paths upgrade =

Spacewalk ver. 0.2 introduced new layout of /var/satellite directory (change coming with multiple distribution support). To migrate
existing packages into new locations, use update-packages script (spacewalk-backend-satellite-tools) with a valid database connection string.

{{{
# /usr/bin/update-packages --db=spacewalk/spacewalk@xe
}}}


=  Update configuration  =


If you're upgrading Spacewalk 0.1 to version 0.2, add the following line into /etc/rhn/rhn.conf and /etc/rhn/default/rhn_web.conf:


{{{
web.product_name = Spacewalk
}}}
