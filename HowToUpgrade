Setup your spacewalk yum repo to point to the version of spacewalk you wish to upgrade to:

{{{

gpgkey=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
}}}

Stop your spacewalk server. To accomplish this, execute following command as root:

{{{
# service rhn-satellite stop
}}}

Perform package upgrade using yum:

{{{
# yum upgrade spacewalk
}}}


=  Schema upgrade  =

Install spacewalk-schema-upgrade package:

{{{
yum install spacewalk-schema-upgrade
}}}

Make sure your spacewalk server is down:

{{{

}}}

Make sure your oracle-xe server is running:

{{{
# service oracle-xe status
