= Spacewalk Upgrade Instructions =

Spacewalk upgrade from version 0.1 to 0.2 involves several basic steps:
  1.  Configuration files and spacewalk database backup
  2.  Package upgrade
  3.  Schema upgrade
  4.  Upgrading package paths
  5.  Update spacewalk configuration
  6.  Restart Spacewalk

----


=  Database and configuration backup  =


  *  For existing configuration files, create a backup of everything under /etc/sysconfig/rhn/ and /etc/rhn/
  *  For instructions on how to create a backup of your existing spacewalk database consult either Oracle documentation or contact your DBA


= Package upgrade =

Setup your yum configuration to point to spacewalk 0.2 repo:

{{{
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/0.2/rhel/5Server/$basearch/
gpgkey=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
}}}

Stop your spacewalk server. To accomplish this, execute following command as root:

{{{
# service rhn-satellite stop
}}}

Perform package upgrade using yum:

{{{
# yum upgrade spacewalk
}}}


=  Schema upgrade  =

Make sure your spacewalk server is down:

{{{
# service rhn-satellite status
}}}

Make sure your oracle server is running. For oracle-xe that would be:

{{{
# service oracle-xe status
}}}

Run spacewalk-schema-upgrade script to upgrade database schema:

{{{
# /usr/bin/spacewalk-schema-upgrade
}}}


Log files from schema upgrade are being put into /var/log/spacewalk/schema-upgrade


=  Package paths upgrade =

Spacewalk ver. 0.2 introduced new layout of /var/satellite directory (change coming with multiple distribution support). To migrate
existing packages into new locations, use update-packages script (spacewalk-backend-satellite-tools) with a valid database connection string.

{{{
# /usr/bin/update-packages --db=spacewalk/spacewalk@xe
}}}

=  Update configuration  =


If you're upgrading Spacewalk 0.1 to version 0.2, add the following line into /etc/rhn/rhn.conf and /etc/rhn/default/rhn_web.conf:


{{{
web.product_name = Spacewalk
}}}


=  Restart spacewalk  =

If all of the above steps completed successfully, you can start your upgraded spacewalk:

{{{
# service rhn-satellite start
}}}
