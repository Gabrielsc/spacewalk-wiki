= Spacewalk Upgrade Instructions =

These are upgrade instruction for upgrading Spacewalk 0.7 to Spacewalk 0.8.

These upgrade instruction apply to Spacewalk installations meeting the following criteria:

  *  Spacewalk 0.7 running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Server or CentOS 5
  *  Your Spacewalk uses Oracle 10g / Oracle-XE as a database backend

----


Spacewalk upgrade involves several basic steps:
  1.  Configuration files and Spacewalk database backup
  2.  Package upgrade
  3.  Schema upgrade
  4.  SHA-256 content update
  5.  Upgrade of Spacewalk configuration
  6.  Restart Spacewalk
  7.  Update of monitoring setup
  8.  Restart Spacewalk
  9. Rebuild search indexes

----


= Assumptions =

  * For RHEL or CentOS, you will need the Base, EPEL 5 repositories enabled for dependencies.
  * You had set up your yum repository configuration to point to spacewalk 0.8 repo. For the repo setup specifics, see HowToInstall#SettingupSpacewalkrepo.


=  Database and configuration backup  =


  *  For existing configuration files, create a backup of everything under /etc/sysconfig/rhn /etc/rhn and /etc/jabberd
  *  Backup your ssl build directory, ordinarily /root/ssl-build
  *  For instructions on how to create a backup of your existing Spacewalk database consult either Oracle documentation or contact your DBA


= Package upgrade =

Stop your Spacewalk by running:

{{{
# /usr/sbin/rhn-satellite stop
}}}

Perform package upgrade using yum:

{{{
# yum upgrade
}}}

During the upgrade, you may notice messages printed to the terminal when installing oracle-instantclient-selinux and spacewalk-selinux.
These messages are produced by restorecon and do not pose any harm.
On the contrary, these messages indicate relabeling of file system objects that is required for correct Spacewalk and SELinux symbiosis.

=  Schema upgrade  =

Make sure your Spacewalk server is down:

{{{
# /usr/sbin/rhn-satellite status
}}}

Make sure your oracle server is running (likely it isn't running since the earlier 'rhn-satellite stop' command stops the oracle-xe processes). For oracle-xe that would be:

{{{
# service oracle-xe status
}}}

If Oracle isn't running, start it

{{{
# service oracle-xe start
}}}
Run spacewalk-schema-upgrade script to upgrade database schema:

{{{
# /usr/bin/spacewalk-schema-upgrade
}}}


Log files from schema upgrade are being put into /var/log/spacewalk/schema-upgrade

= SHA-256 content update =

In Spacewalk 0.8, it is necessary to update checksums and filer locations for existing SHA-256 content. This is to ensure all previously pushed 
SHA-256 capable packages (Fedora 11, Fedora-12) will have correct checksums and will be stored in correct locations on filer.

Note 1: This will likely be a slow process (approximately 5000 packages / hour on an entry level hardware).

Note 2: With --debug option specified, all actions will be logged into /var/log/rhn/update-packages.log

{{{
# update-packages --debug --verbose --db $(spacewalk-cfg-get default_db) --update-sha256
}}}


=  Upgrade of Spacewalk configuration  =

For Spacewalk 0.8, it is required to deploy configuration for cobbler and update configuration of apache SSL virtual host. Both steps can be accomplished by running:

{{{
# spacewalk-setup --disconnected --upgrade
}}}

You'll be asked by spacewalk-setup to provide your database connection information.  This is the same information you provided to HowToInstall. Following this spacewalk-setup will ask you whether you wish to
have your apache ssl configuration (/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf) updated by spacewalk-setup. You may choose to setup your ssl.conf manually, in which
case you have to make sure you have the following directives present in your /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf:

{{{
# cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
...
<VirtualHost _default_:443>
...
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/spacewalk.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/spacewalk.key
RewriteEngine on
RewriteOptions inherit
SSLProxyEngine on
<IfModule mod_jk.c>
    JkMountCopy On
</IfModule>
...
</VirtualHost>
...
}}}

Restore some of the custom values you might have set previously in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf from the backup of your configuration files, such as:

  *  debug = 3
  *  pam_auth_service = rhn-satellite

Clean jabberd authentication database:

{{{
# rm -f /var/lib/jabberd/db/authreg.db
}}}

= Restart Spacewalk = 

{{{
# /usr/sbin/rhn-satellite start
}}}

= Update of monitoring setup =

Recent Spacewalk installations may have set several important monitoring configuration values incorrectly. To correct these, run the following
as root (note that you should run this command regardless of your current monitoring status; even on installations that never had monitoring
enabled, running this script will have no ill effect):

{{{
# /usr/share/spacewalk/setup/upgrade/rhn-update-monitoring.pl
}}}

You may now choose to activate monitoring or both monitoring & monitoring scout on your Spacewalk.

If you had monitoring enabled previously and wish to re-enable it now (without having to do so in the web ui), run as root:

{{{
# /usr/share/spacewalk/setup/upgrade/rhn-enable-monitoring.pl
}}}

If you'd like to re-enable both monitoring and monitoring scout on your Spacewalk (without having to do so in the web ui), instead run as root

{{{
# /usr/share/spacewalk/setup/upgrade/rhn-enable-monitoring.pl --enable-scout
}}}

=  Restart Spacewalk  =

If all of the above steps completed successfully, you can start your upgraded Spacewalk server.

{{{
# /usr/sbin/rhn-satellite restart
}}}

= Rebuild search indexes =

After a successful upgrade, it is recommended to rebuild search indexes used by Spacewalk search engine (rhn-search service).
This can be accomplished by the following:

{{{
# /etc/init.d/rhn-search cleanindex
}}}
