= How to use software crash reporting in Spacewalk =

== Overview ==

Spacewalk 1.9 extended on the software crash functionality originally introduced in Spacewalk 1.8.

If you're using / have installed '''abrt''' ([https://fedorahosted.org/abrt/]) on your systems registered to Spacewalk, you may take advantage
of the software crash functionality provided by Spacewalk.

This functionality allows:

* your clients to automatically report software crashes captured by abrt directly to the Spacewalk server
* process the captured crashes in a centralized fasion: WEB UI & API for manipulation with the crashes.

== Usage ==

To be able to use the functionality, you need to install '''spacewalk-abrt''' package on your clients. The package is available in Spacewalk client yum repository. The package comes with the following configuration file:

{{{
/etc/libreport/events.d/spacewalk.conf
}}}

This configuration file instructs abrt daemon to use /usr/bin/spacewalk-abrt utility to automatically report every new crash that occurs on the system to your Spacewalk server. This is done in a fully automated fashion and ordinarilly does not require any human intervention.
