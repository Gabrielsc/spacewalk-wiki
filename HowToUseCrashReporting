= How to use software crash reporting in Spacewalk =

== Overview ==

Spacewalk 1.9 extended on the software crash reporting functionality originally introduced in Spacewalk 1.8.

If you're using / have installed '''abrt''' ([https://fedorahosted.org/abrt/]) on your systems registered to Spacewalk, you may take advantage
of the software crash functionality provided by Spacewalk.

This functionality allows:

* your clients to automatically report software crashes captured by abrt directly to the Spacewalk server
* process the captured crashes in a centralized fasion: WEB UI & API for manipulation with the crashes.

== Quick start ==

To use the software crash reporting functionality:

1. Install '''spacewalk-abrt''' package on your client system(s). This package will install '''abrt''' as its dependency. Note: neither abrt nor spacewalk-abrt are available for RHEL-5 / CentOS-5.
2. In your webui, navigate to:

    Systems -> | desired system | -> Software -> Software Crashes

to see the list of software crashes that occurred on the registered system. Click on the particular crash to see the crash details and crash files captured for this crash report.

3. Use the following API calls to manipulate with the reported software crashes:

{{{
system.crash.getLastReportDate()
system.crash.getUniqueCrashCount()
system.crash.getTotalCrashCount()
system.crash.listSystemCrashes()
system.crash.listSystemCrashFiles()
system.crash.deleteCrash()
system.crash.getCrashFileUrl()
system.crash.getCrashFile()
}}}

Consult the API documentation for further details.

== Usage ==

To be able to use the functionality, you need to install '''spacewalk-abrt''' package on your clients. The package is available in Spacewalk client yum repository. The package comes with the following configuration file:

{{{
/etc/libreport/events.d/spacewalk.conf
}}}

This configuration file instructs abrt daemon to use /usr/bin/spacewalk-abrt utility to automatically report every new crash that occurs on the system to your Spacewalk server. This is done in a fully automated fashion and ordinarilly does not require any human intervention.
