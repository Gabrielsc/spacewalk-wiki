= How to use software crash reporting in Spacewalk =

[[TOC]]

== Overview ==

If you're using / have installed '''abrt''' ([https://fedorahosted.org/abrt/]) on your systems registered to Spacewalk, you may take advantage
of the software crash functionality provided by Spacewalk.

Software crash reporting functionality was introduced first in Spacewalk 1.8 and extended later in Spacewalk 1.9 and Spacewalk 2.0.

This functionality allows:

* your registered clients to automatically report software crashes captured by abrt directly to the Spacewalk server
* you to process the captured crashes in a centralized way
  * ability to see the software crashes that occurred on a system
  * ability to manipulate directly with the crash files captured with the crash (further processing, reporting a bug)
  * adding custom notes to a particular crash
  * ability to group similar software crashes across multiple systems in an organization
  * creating crash reports with '''spacewalk-report'''

== Quick start ==

To use the software crash reporting functionality:

1. Install '''spacewalk-abrt''' package on your client system(s). This package will install '''abrt''' as its dependency. Note: neither abrt nor spacewalk-abrt are available for RHEL-5 / CentOS-5.
2. In your webui, navigate to:
{{{
    Systems -> [desired system] -> Software -> Software Crashes
}}}

to see the list of software crashes that occurred on the registered system. Click on the particular crash to see the crash details and crash files captured for this crash report.

3. Use the following API calls to manipulate with the reported software crashes:
{{{
system.crash.getLastReportDate()
system.crash.getUniqueCrashCount()
system.crash.getTotalCrashCount()
system.crash.listSystemCrashes()
system.crash.listSystemCrashFiles()
system.crash.deleteCrash()
system.crash.getCrashFileUrl()
system.crash.getCrashFile()
}}}

Consult the API documentation for further details.

== Advanced Usage ==

=== Crash Notes ===

Spacewalk 2.0 supports custom crash notes (adding / viewing / removing).

To manipulate with the crash notes in the webui, navigate to
{{{
Systems -> [desired system] -> Software -> Software Crashes -> [desired software crash] -> Crash Notes
}}}

To manipulate with the crash notes using the API, use the following calls:
{{{
system.crash.createCrashNote()
system.crash.deleteCrashNote()
system.crash.getCrashNotesForCrash()
}}}

=== Similar Software Crashes ===

Spacewalk 2.0 allows you to see identical / similar software crashes across multiple systems in your organization.

ABRT assigns every software crash a UUID. Crashes with identical UUID may potentially indicate similar or identical software crashes.

To see the overview of software crashes that occurred in your organization grouped by their UUID, navigate to
{{{
Systems -> Software Crash Overview
}}}

You can similarly use the following API calls to see similar / identical software crashes in your organization:
{{{
system.crash.getCrashOverview()
system.crash.getCrashesByUuid()
}}}

=== Organization Configuration ===

Spacewalk allows you to configure the following crash-related settings in your organization:

* turn the crash reporting on / off
* turn the crash file upload on / off
* crash file upload size limit, i.e. the size of a single crash file that can be uploaded with every crash report 

To configure these settings in webui, navigate to:
{{{
Admin -> | [your organization] | -> Configuration
}}}

You can also use the following API calls to configure your organization:
{{{
org.getCrashFileSizeLimit()
org.setCrashFileSizeLimit()
org.isCrashReportingEnabled()
org.setCrashReporting()
org.isCrashfileUploadEnabled()
org.setCrashfileUpload()
}}}

=== Reporting ===

Spacewalk allows you to use the following crash-related reports with the ''spacewalk-report'' tool:
{{{
system-crash-count
system-crash-details
}}}

== Usage details ==

The spacewalk-abrt package has two important components:
1. configuration file for abrt: /etc/libreport/events.d/spacewalk.conf
2. spacewalk-abrt utility: /usr/bin/spacewalk-abrt

spacewalk-abrt package contains the following configuration file:

{{{
/etc/libreport/events.d/spacewalk.conf
}}}

This configuration file instructs abrt daemon to use /usr/bin/spacewalk-abrt utility to automatically report every new crash that occurs on the system to your Spacewalk server. This is done in a fully automated fashion and ordinarilly does not require any human intervention.

Should you ever need to report a crash manually, use the spacewalk-abrt utility, executed from your client system:
{{{
# spacewalk-abrt --help
Usage: spacewalk-abrt [options]
  Commands:
    Specify one of the commands below

    --report=REPORT     Upload content of the specified problem directory
    --update-count=UPDATE_COUNT
                        Update crash count for the specified problem directory
    --sync              Synchronize missing problem directories
}}}

Use --report option to report a single crash:
{{{
# abrt-cli list

# spacewalk-abrt --report /var/tmp/abrt/ccpp-2013-02-28-15:48:50-8820
}}}

Use --sync option to report all crashes that occurred on your system:
{{{
# spacewalk-abrt --sync
}}}


== Crash files ==

The crash files captured by abrt will be uploaded to your Spacewalk server for every crash report. These files can be downloaded from webui or via API. On your Spacewalk server, these crash files will be physically stored
on the file system under:
{{{
/var/satellite/systems/$org_id/$system_id/crashes/$crash_name/
}}}
