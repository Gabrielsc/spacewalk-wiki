== Jabber and OSAD client connection issues ==

I found out that our firewalls have session timeouts, thus the jabber connections were timing out. This also causes the strange behaviour of a clients 'netstat -an |grep
5222' command saying "ESTABLISHED" even though there is no connection on the spacewalk server.

After doing the following, I am having no issues with time-outs...

{{{
sed -i 's/<interval>.*/<interval>120<\/interval>/' /etc/jabberd/*.xml*
sed -i 's/<keepalive>.*/<keepalive>120<\/keepalive>/' /etc/jabberd/*.xml*
sed -i 's/<idle>.*/<idle>600<\/idle>/' /etc/jabberd/*.xml* |grep '<idle>'

rhn-satellite restart
}}}

...and restarted OSAD on all clients (although this step may not be necessary).

The above settings are all explained in the .xml configs under /etc/jabberd/. Essentially, it will send a "whitespace" character as a keepalive, every 2 minutes in the above case. I verified this in tcpdump and jabber does only send 1 small packet every 2 minutes. Of course depending on your firewall time-out settings, you may need to tweak this a bit.

Hope this helps someone else.
