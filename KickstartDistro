= Steps to kickstarting Fedora =

(Currently this for us developers, but will be changed to be for users before release.)


== Using a fedora DVD mount to /mnt/iso ==

 1.  Create a fedora 9 channel
 2.  Push Fedora 9 content   "rhnpush --server=http://SW_FQDN/APP --channel fedora9  -d /mnt/iso/Packages "
 3.  Create kickstart tree  "sh /mnt/svn/eng/scripts/make-ks-tree.sh --channel fedora9 --source /mnt/iso --dsn rhnsat/rhnsat@rhnsat --install-type fedora9 "
 4.  If that is ok, run the same command again with "--commit"
 4.  Create a kickstart, selecting the fedora 9 channel and it's kickstart tree
 5.  kickstart using the url  http://SW_FQDN/kickstart/ks/label/KS_LABEL   where KS_LABEL is the kickstart label that you specified.



== Things I had to do as a developer: ==

{{{
insert into rhnKSInstallType (id, label, name)
        values (rhn_ksinstalltype_id_seq.nextval,
                'fedora9','Fedora 9'
        );
}}}
Change certain advanced options to be not required (Since F-9 didn't like them)


In rhnKickstartCommandName_data.sql
{{{
-values (rhn_kscommandname_id_seq.nextval, 'langsupport', 'Y', 13, 'Y');
+values (rhn_kscommandname_id_seq.nextval, 'langsupport', 'Y', 13, 'N');
-values (rhn_kscommandname_id_seq.nextval, 'mouse', 'Y', 15, 'Y');
+values (rhn_kscommandname_id_seq.nextval, 'mouse', 'Y', 15, 'N');
}}}
