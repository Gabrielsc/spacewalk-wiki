To resolve the issue, install the Spacewalk 1.0 certificate, if you have already upgraded to Spacewalk 1.0 run this command (service/server restart is '''not''' required) 

{{{ 
#!sh 
$ sudo rhn-satellite-activate --rhn-cert /usr/share/spacewalk/setup/spacewalk-public.cert --disconnected 
}}} 

If you are still running version 0.8 download the 1.0 certificate and install (again, no need to restart the server/service) 

{{{ 
#!sh 
$ wget 'http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=spacewalk.git;a=blob_plain;f=branding/setup/spacewalk-public.cert;h=d7674be743358ad2f20346d78d9d53e8fe11f034;hb=HEAD' -O spacewalk-public.cert 
$ sudo rhn-satellite-activate --rhn-cert spacewalk-public.cert --disconnected
