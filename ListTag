=== List Tag ===

There have been several list tag implementations throughout the history of the project.  The original perl list tag, an older Java list tag, and the new Java list tag.  When writing new pages, or updating existing pages, we use the new Java list tag.  It has the most features (including filters, pagination, page size selector, csv support), and is the easiest to use.


=== Using the new list tag ===

Like any struts page, it consists of 

a) An action
b) A jsp

The action may be responsible for retrieving/manipulating data and attaching data to the request and the jsp is responsible for formatting and displaying the data.  Both require specific things related to this list tag.  

== Action side ==


== jsp side ==



== filters == 

== alpha bar ==

== csv export ==
To add CSV support to a page add the below tag to the jsp.

<rl:csv dataset="pageList"
    name="userList" 
    exportColumns="userLogin,userLastName,userFirstName,roleNames,lastLoggedIn"/>

"pageList" is the name of the 'List'

"userList" should match the name given to the <rl:list> this works with. This allows the CSV tag to reuse an Elaborator if it was stored with the associated <rl:list>.

exportColumns is a comma separated string of attributes you want to export.


Note: The CSV is handled by it's own Action, CSVDownloadAction, all data is passed to it in Session context. 


== page size widget == 
To add a page Size widge (that can now be seen on the rhn/systems/SystemList.do page, simply use the PageSizeDecorator:
{{{
<rl:decorator name="PageSizeDecorator"/>
}}}
Feel free to look in system_listdisplay.jspf for an example of usage.
