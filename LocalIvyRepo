= Local Ivy Repository =
There are times when you need to use a jar right now but don't want to put it in the 
ivy repo or tmp jars.  So what do you do?  Create a local ivy repo for it.

{{{
 mkdir -p $HOME/.ivy/{PROJECTNAME}/local/
 cp name-version.jar $HOME/.ivy/{PROJECTNAME}/local/
 vi ivy.xml
}}}

put your jar in the above directory (name-version.jar) then update ivy.xml.
It will look at your local ivy repo first.

Enjoy.
