If you've got a few Fedora workstations you're likely to want to have some sort of centralised management for them.  Spacewalk is one tool which can provide this.  We assume you have a spacewalk server and the need to deploy multiple Fedora 9 clients.

== Channel Setup ==
We'll create a channel holding all the Fedora rpms you may want to deploy to clients.  It is encouraged that you use a sub-channel for each repository you pull from.  For example we have a "Fedora 9 x86_64" channel.  This channel contains all the Fedora 9 packages from Fedora.  A "Livna" sub-channel contains packages from the livna repository.  Essentially you want the following structure

  * Fedora 9 x86_64 chanel
    * Livna sub-channel
    * My custom packages sub-channel

The [UploadFedoraContent] page describes how to create a channel, reposync your required repositories and then upload the content to spacewalk.  At the end of this process you'll end up with a copy of the entire Fedora repository on your disk and another copy living inside of spacewalk (actually in /var).  This consumes quite a bit of space.  Furthermore rhnpush'ing an entire Fedora repository to a spacewalk server can take several days.  Some have managed it in a single day, others find it takes 2-3 days on more modest hardware.

You'll periodically want to resync the Fedora repository and upload the updated packages to spacewalk.  This is a repeat of the 2-3 day rhnpush process.  You then have to push the updated packages to your clients.  This pushing practice is described below.
