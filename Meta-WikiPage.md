[[PageOutline]]

= __Meta-Wiki Page__ =
This is a page to document the documentation as it were, basically just a place to put requests for further doucmentation if you think something is missing, a page to keep a list of stuff that needs working on and a road map to keep track of bigger ideas...

== User Documentation Requests ==
 * A [Preface]
 * A Managing RHEL Systems page.
 * A Managing CentOS Systems page.
 * Dependency Notes - Version 0.7?
 * Dependency Notes - Version 0.6?
 * Dependency Notes - Version 0.5? 

== Documentation Marked as Work in Progress/Todo List ==
To update this click this [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/search?q=%22Work+in+Progress%22&wiki=on&changeset=on&ticket=on link] and then just pull out the conventions, this and the user docs front page...

 * [wiki:Spacewalkonvm]
 * [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/SupportUser]
 * [wiki:MultiArchEnhancements]

== User Docs Road Map ==
A place to record larger general improvements to the user documentation and to anticipate pages and things that will need updating when a new release is available...

 * Update the conventions page to include some more guidelines perhaps. Specifically PageOutline, underlining of first header and some sort of template footer with a link back to the user docs?
 * Move everything applicable to being a sub-page of UserDocs (i.e. UserDocs/Meta-WikiPage).
 * Add diagrams and screen shots where possible.

=== Things to update upon release ===
 * Pull the release notes from the email list and put them into a new page, shuffle the old version to a numbered version.
 * Ditto the howtoinstall page.
 * Generate a ListofRPMsInstalled page and add to appendices.
 * Review the "Known Issues & Current Limitations" section.
 * Review the "Brain Box" section to see if any features have been added.
