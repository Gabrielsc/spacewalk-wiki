== The Problem ==

Currently in spacewalk only one package on the satellite can be pushed to a single org.  So for example rootfiles-8.1-1.1.1.noarch is shipped with RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and Fedora 9.  All 3 have different GPG signatures and thus different md5sums.   We need a way to differentiate content from different sources that is basically the same.


== The Solution ==

We obviously need some field to differentiate between content from different vendors, so here are some ideas:

  * Have the user specify a vendor when pushing content (This could be automated when we have automated tools for grabbing/pushing content).  This is handy in that it would make it fairly easy to keep CentOS content from getting into RHEL 5 channels (if support was added), and to see all "Fedora" content, "CentOS" content etc...
