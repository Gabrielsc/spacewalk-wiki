[http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/xe/htdocs/102xelinsoft.html Download Oracle XE]

You may need an account to download the rpms. Seems like a crap shoot to me.

 * download oracle-xe-10.2.0-1.0.i386.rpm or oracle-xe-univ-10.2.0.1-1.0.i386.rpm
 * download oracle-xe-client-10.2.1-1.0.i386.rpm

=== Letting yum resolve deps ===
nogpgcheck is required because the oracle rpms are not signed.
 * sudo yum install --nogpgcheck oracle-xe-univ-10.2.0-1.0.i386.rpm oracle-xe-client-10.2.1-1.0.i386.rpm

=== manually ===

 * sudo yum install libaio
 * sudo rpm -Uvh oracle-xe-univ-10.2.0-1.0.i386.rpm oracle-xe-client-10.2.1-1.0.i386.rpm


== setup server ==
Configure the Oracle XE database


{{{
 sudo /etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure
}}}


Here are some sane values:
{{{
 HTTP port: 9000 (8080 is tomcat)
 listener port: 1521
 password:dog8code for SYS/SYSTEM
 have oracle start at boot: y
}}}

Login to the webui and configure a user:
 * browse to http://127.0.0.1:9000/apex
 * login: sys
 * click Administration
 * click Database Users
 * click "Create >" button
 * username: '''spacewalk'''
 * password: '''spacewalk'''
 * Confirm password: '''spacewalk'''
 * Give spacewalk all system privileges (check All)
 * click Create button
That's it, proceed with client setup.

== setup client ==
You need to put the Oracle clients on your path.
{{{
 export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/client/bin/
}}}

You also need to configure the tns names entry for your database. Place the following into {{{/etc/tnsnames.ora}}}:
{{{
 XE =
    (DESCRIPTION =
       (ADDRESS_LIST =
          (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = localhost)(PORT = 1521))
       )
       (CONNECT_DATA =
          (SERVICE_NAME = xe)
       )
    )
}}}

Test your connection with sqlplus:
{{{
sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe
}}}

If '''spacewalk''' user was properly setup you should see a '''Connected to:''' message:

{{{
