= Oracle 10g Express Edition Setup =
== Limitations ==
 * will use maximum of 1GB RAM
 * 4GB user data (max)
 * may be installed on a multiple CPU server, but may only be executed on one processor in any server
 * one database (max)

The full license agreement is available via the download page linked below.

== Installation ==
You can download [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/xe/htdocs/102xelinsoft.html Oracle 10g Express Edition (XE) here]. You will need an Oracle OTN account to download the RPMs and you will need to accept the license agreements. Download "Oracle Database 10g Express Edition ('''Universal''')", i.e. Multi-byte Unicode/UTF-8 database not "Western European" Single-byte LATIN1 database.

 * oracle-xe-univ-10.2.0.1-1.0.i386.rpm

You will also need a client. For this you should download the Oracle Instant Client: [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/linuxsoft.html i386] or [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/linuxx86_64soft.html x86_64]. Do '''NOT''' use oracle-xe-client. Download all four (4) of the following (where ARCH is either i386 or x86_64). For now, stick with the 10.2.0.4 version.

 * oracle-instantclient-basic-10.2.0.4-1.ARCH.rpm
 * oracle-instantclient-jdbc-10.2.0.4-1.ARCH.rpm
 * oracle-instantclient-devel-10.2.0.4-1.ARCH.rpm
 * oracle-instantclient-sqlplus-10.2.0.4-1.ARCH.rpm 

If you want to run with SELinux enabled, you need to install oracle-xe-selinux and oracle-instantclient-selinux from the Spacewalk repo.

=== Letting yum resolve deps ===
nogpgcheck is required because the oracle rpms are not signed.
 * sudo yum install --nogpgcheck oracle-xe-univ-10.2.0.1-1.0.i386.rpm oracle-instantclient-basic*.rpm oracle-instantclient-jdbc*.rpm oracle-instantclient-devel*.rpm oracle-instantclient-sqlplus*.rpm

=== manually ===

 * sudo yum install libaio.i386
 * sudo rpm -Uvh oracle-xe-univ-10.2.0.1-1.0.i386.rpm oracle-instantclient-basic-10.2.0.4-1.*.rpm oracle-instantclient-devel-10.2.0.4-1.*.rpm oracle-instantclient-jdbc-10.2.0.4-1.*.rpm oracle-instantclient-sqlplus*.rpm

'''NOTE:''' Don't forget to have glibc.i686 installed on an x86_64 system. It will not be pulled in automagically!!!
 * sudo yum install glibc.i686

== Server Setup ==
Configure the Oracle XE database

  * Ensure your hostname is in /etc/hosts prior to running "oracle-xe configure"

{{{
 sudo /etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure
}}}


Here are some sane values:
{{{
 HTTP port: 9000 (8080 is tomcat)
 listener port: 1521
 password:<password> for SYS/SYSTEM
 have oracle start at boot: y
}}}

'''NOTE:''' if you messed up these entries, you '''WILL''' have to uninstall and reinstall.

 * rpm -e oracle-xe-client oracle-xe-univ
 * OracleXeSetup#Installation


Login to the webui and configure a user (if you don't have access to localhost see OracleXeWebAccessPrep):

 * browse to http://127.0.0.1:9000/apex
 * login: sys
 * click Administration
 * click Database Users
 * click "Create >" button
 * username: '''spacewalk'''
 * password: '''spacewalk'''
 * Confirm password: '''spacewalk'''
 * Give spacewalk all system privileges (check All and add DBA role) 
 * click Create button

Setup server environment for oracle user:
{{{
  echo ".  /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/bin/oracle_env.sh" >> ~oracle/.bash_profile
}}} 

That's it, proceed with [OracleXeSetup#setupclient client setup]. 
 * If you weren't able to connect to http://127.0.0.1:9000/apex, check /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/admin/XE/bdump/alert_XE.log for errors.     
 * This is an example error when oracle isn't able to resolve your hostname, [http://virag.sharma.googlepages.com/oraclexemadeeasy#_Getting_ORA-600_error more info] 
{{{ 
  Errors in file /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/admin/XE/udump/xe_ora_4382.trc: 
  ORA-00600: internal error code, arguments: [keltnfy-ldmInit], [46], [1], [], [], [], [], [] 
  USER: terminating instance due to error 600 
}}} 
 
== setup client == 
You also need to configure the tns names entry for your database. Place the following into {{{/etc/tnsnames.ora}}}: 
{{{ 
XE = 
    (DESCRIPTION = 
       (ADDRESS_LIST = 
          (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = localhost)(PORT = 1521)) 
       ) 
       (CONNECT_DATA = 
          (SERVICE_NAME = xe) 
       ) 
    ) 
}}} 
 

Test your connection with sqlplus: 
{{{ 
sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe 
}}} 
 
 
If '''spacewalk''' user was properly setup you should see a '''Connected to:''' message: 
 
{{{ 
SQL*Plus: Release 10.2.0.1.0 - Production on Sat May 17 10:52:56 2008

Connected to: 
Oracle Database 10g Express Edition Release 10.2.0.1.0 - Production 
 
SQL> 
}}} 
 
 '''NOTE:''' you might want to install 'rlwrap' to make your sqlplus more usable. {{{rlwrap}}} will retain 
 a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library) 'curses'] like behavior with sqlplus such as maintaining sql call history, etc. 
 {{{yum install rlwrap}}} 
 you can then do  
 {{{ 
 rlwrap sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe 
 }}}  

== additional Oracle configuration ==
 
Oracle XE is initially configured to grant 40 connections to its database.  Spacewalk needs more than this default configuration.  We recommend increasing this setting to 400. 

Oracle XE has a bug that causes an Internal Server Error (500) in Spacewalk when viewing Systems -> Pick a System -> Software -> Packages -> Install New Package
(URL: https://spacewalk.example.com/rhn/systems/details/packages/InstallPackages.do?sid=**********) or when running
{{{rhnreg_ks}}} to register a client.

In order to avoid these two problems we need to increase the max processes in Oracle and to 
 
{{{ 
# sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe 
 
.. 
 
SQL> alter system set processes = 400 scope=spfile; 
 
System altered. 

SQL> alter system set "_optimizer_filter_pred_pullup"=false scope=spfile; 
 
System altered. 
 
SQL> alter system set "_optimizer_cost_based_transformation"=off scope=spfile; 
 
System altered. 
 
SQL> quit 
 
# /sbin/service oracle-xe restart 
}}}

If you encounder 500s with messages like
{{{
DATABASE CONNECTION TO 'xe' LOST
}}}

and /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/admin/XE/bdump/alert_XE.log having messages like
{{{
ORA-07445: exception encountered: core dump [08F93BDE] [SIGSEGV] [Address not mapped to object] [0x34979C] [] []
}}}

you might try to workaround it with
{{{ 
# sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe 

SQL>  alter system set query_rewrite_enabled=TRUE ;

System altered.

SQL> quit
}}}

as suggested in http://stephensorablog.blogspot.com/2006/05/solution-to-dreaded-ora-07445-error.html
 
== setup development schema (optional) == 
 
This is only for use if running a development environment or development version of spacewalk.  See [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/DevelopmentWorkstationSetup Dev Station setup] for this info.

 
= Known Issues =

 * If you run with SELinux enabled, you should also install oracle-xe-selinux and oracle-instantclient-selinux packages, or you might experience errors like:
