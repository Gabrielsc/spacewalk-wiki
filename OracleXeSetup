== Limitations ==

 * will use maximum of 1GB RAM
 * 4GB user data (max)
 * may be installed on a multiple CPU server, but may only be executed on one processor in any server
 * one database (max)

The full license agreement is available via the download page linked below.

== Download ==

=== Server ===

You can download Oracle 10g Express Edition (XE) Server from Oracle's [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/xe/htdocs/102xelinsoft.html Oracle Database 10g Express Edition Downloads for Linux x86] page. You will need an Oracle OTN account to download the rpms and you will need to accept the license agreements. Download the "Oracle Database 10g Express Edition ('''Universal''')"

 * oracle-xe-univ-10.2.0.1-1.0.i386.rpm

which is the Multi-byte Unicode/UTF-8 database, not the "Western European" Single-byte LATIN1 database.

=== Client ===

You will also need the Oracle Instant Client: [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/linuxsoft.html i386] or [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/linuxx86_64soft.html x86_64] version. Download the following two rpms (where ARCH is either i386 or x86_64):

 * oracle-instantclient-basic-10.2.0.4-1.ARCH.rpm
 * oracle-instantclient-sqlplus-10.2.0.4-1.ARCH.rpm 

For now, stick with the 10.2.0.4 version. Do '''NOT''' use oracle-xe-client.

== Before installing Oracle XE ==

If you want to run with SELinux enabled, run the following two commands to create the group and user for the oracle-xe-univ package, prior to installing said package:

{{{
# /usr/sbin/groupadd -r dba
# /usr/sbin/useradd -r -M -g dba -d /usr/lib/oracle/xe -s /bin/bash oracle
}}}

This is needed to give the oracle user uid below 500. See [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/Features/SELinux Features/SELinux] for more details and limitations of SELinux support.

== Install ==

{{{
# yum -y install bc libc.so.6 libaio.so.1 # this installs bc, plus glibc and libaio in 32bit variant
# yum -y localinstall --nogpgcheck oracle-xe-univ-10.2.0.1-1.0.i386.rpm
# yum -y localinstall --nogpgcheck oracle-instantclient-basic*.rpm oracle-instantclient-sqlplus*.rpm
# yum -y install oracle-lib-compat
}}}

=== Notes ===
  * '''bc''' is a dependency of oracle-xe which is not resolved automatically causing the oracle install to be incomplete!
  * '''--nogpgcheck''' is required because the Oracle RPMs are not signed.
  * If the installation of oracle-xe-univ fails on Fedora 12 with {{{error: "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables" is an unknown key}}} and similar errors, just rerun that step and it should work for the second time.
  * Don't forget to have glibc.i686 installed on an x86_64 system. It will not be pulled in automagically!

   <h2>Warning</h2>
   <div style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" >
      <p>Do not run {{{oracle_env.sh}}} (or {{{oracle_env.csh}}}) in your environment settings. The Instantclient libraries will work fine without it. It is useful only for command line Oracle XE server management whilst using the {{{oracle}}} user account.</p>
   </div>
</div>
}}}

== Install SELinux Policy ==

If you are running with SELinux enabled then install the following packages from the Spacewalk repo before running {{{oracle-xe configure}}}:

{{{
# yum -y install oracle-xe-selinux oracle-instantclient-selinux oracle-instantclient-sqlplus-selinux
}}}

This will likely pull in {{{compat-libstdc++-33}}}, {{{oracle-lib-compat}}}, and {{{oracle-nofcontext-selinux}}} as well.

== Server Setup ==

Ensure your hostname is in /etc/hosts prior to configuring the Oracle XE database.

Configure the Oracle XE database by running

{{{
# /etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure
}}}

Here are some sane values for the configure:

{{{
 HTTP port for Oracle Application Express: 9055
 Database listener port: 1521
 Password for SYS/SYSTEM: <password>
 Start at boot: y
}}}

Note that the port 8080 is used by tomcat so you cannot accept the default for the Oracle Application Express. Also, the SELinux policy module assumes that the Application Express port is 9055, if you want different value, you need to define it for {{{oracle_port_t}}} via {{{semanage}}}. (This 9055 value is new for Spacewalk 0.7, as we needed to give way to Fedora 12's default allocation of port 9000 for squid.)

If you messed up these entries, you '''WILL''' have to uninstall and reinstall.

 * yum remove oracle-xe-univ
 * OracleXeSetup#Install

== Setup tnsnames.ora ==

Define the service name in {{{/etc/tnsnames.ora}}}:

{{{
cat >> /etc/tnsnames.ora << 'EOF'
XE =
    (DESCRIPTION =
       (ADDRESS_LIST =
          (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = localhost)(PORT = 1521))
       )
       (CONNECT_DATA =
          (SERVICE_NAME = xe)
       )
    )
EOF
restorecon -v /etc/tnsnames.ora
}}} 

== Test your connection with sqlplus ==

Run
{{{
sqlplus 'sys@xe as sysdba'
}}} 
 
You should see something like
 
{{{
SQL*Plus: Release 10.2.0.4.0 - Production on Fri Apr 10 12:59:01 2009

Copyright (c) 1982, 2007, Oracle.  All Rights Reserved.

Enter password:

SQL> 
}}} 

== Create the spacewalk database user ==

{{{
# sqlplus 'sys@xe as sysdba'
SQL> create user spacewalk identified by spacewalk default tablespace users;
SQL> grant dba to spacewalk;
SQL> quit
}}}

Test that

{{{
# sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe
}}}

works.

== Additional Oracle configuration ==

Oracle XE is initially configured to grant 40 connections to its database.  Spacewalk needs more than this default configuration.  We recommend increasing this setting to 400. 

Oracle XE has a bug that causes an Internal Server Error (500) in Spacewalk when viewing Systems -> Pick a System -> Software -> Packages -> Install New Package
(URL: https://spacewalk.example.com/rhn/systems/details/packages/InstallPackages.do?sid=**********) or when running
{{{rhnreg_ks}}} to register a client.

In order to avoid these two problems we need to increase the max processes in Oracle and to 
 
{{{ 
# sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe 
SQL> alter system set processes = 400 scope=spfile; 
SQL> alter system set "_optimizer_filter_pred_pullup"=false scope=spfile; 
SQL> alter system set "_optimizer_cost_based_transformation"=off scope=spfile; 
SQL> quit  
# /sbin/service oracle-xe restart 
}}}

If you encounder 500s with messages like
{{{
DATABASE CONNECTION TO 'xe' LOST
}}}

and /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/admin/XE/bdump/alert_XE.log having messages like
{{{
ORA-07445: exception encountered: core dump [08F93BDE] [SIGSEGV] [Address not mapped to object] [0x34979C] [] []
}}}

you might try to workaround it with
{{{ 
# sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe 
SQL>  alter system set query_rewrite_enabled=TRUE ;
SQL> quit
}}}

as suggested in http://stephensorablog.blogspot.com/2006/05/solution-to-dreaded-ora-07445-error.html

You might want to install 'rlwrap' to make your sqlplus more usable. {{{rlwrap}}} will retain 
a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library) 'curses'] like behavior with sqlplus such as maintaining sql call history, etc.

{{{
yum install rlwrap
}}}
 
You can then do  

{{{ 
rlwrap sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe 
}}}  
 
== Setup development schema (optional) == 
 
This is only for use if running a development environment or development version of spacewalk.  See [https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/wiki/DevelopmentWorkstationSetup Dev Station setup] for this info.

== Troubleshooting ==

 * If you get errors such as: 

{{{
   ORA-01654: unable to extend index SPACEWALK.RHN_PACKAGE_FILE_CID_PID_IDX by 5 in tablespace SPACEWALK
}}}

 or anything from Oracle complaing that it can't '''extend''' an index, a table, etc.. you should run:

{{{
  SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE system ADD DATAFILE '/usr/lib/oracle/xe/oradata/XE/system_02.dbf' size 200m;
  SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE users ADD DATAFILE '/usr/lib/oracle/xe/oradata/XE/users_02.dbf' size 200m;
  SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE undo ADD DATAFILE '/usr/lib/oracle/xe/oradata/XE/undo_02.dbf' size 200m;
}}}

 Quit sqlplus and restart spacewalk and oracle-xe (may not require a restart)

 * If you run out of space in Oracle XE you can try and reclaim some space by shrinking your storage:

 Administration > Storage > Compact Storage in XE webUI (http://your.satellite.tld:9055/apex/) .

 * If you get `ORA-12514` using `oracle-xe` it could be `bc` is not installed, among many other things (ask google about ORA-##### errors)
