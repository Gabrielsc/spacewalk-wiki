== Patch Process ==

So you'd like to send in a patch to Spacewalk?   Great!

First, get the code: DownloadIt

Then read the git instructions on the [GitGuide git guide]. You'll want to send in a patch via {{{git-format-patch}}} to the [wiki:WikiStart#Communication Developer mailing list]. Please notify the list if you have a problem with email bouncing, there have been issues
with the somewhat old installs of mailman causing such problems.

As mentioned on the other page, patches should be applied to HEAD in git, and we'll take care of applying them to other releases as appropriate.
