
== Telemetry ==

Telemetry is the code name for a simple template-based reporting engine for Spacewalk.  This is '''only''' a prototype at this point and needs a significant amount of work/help to flush out the idea/code. Telemetry uses the xmlrpc scripting [http://www.redhat.com/spacewalk/documentation/api/0.2/ API] to fetch data from Spacewalk servers.  It is written completely in Python, leveraging [http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/ Cheetah] for templating, cron for scheduling, and [http://www.djangoproject.com/ Django] for the webui.

=== Requirements ===

 1. Must be able to leverage Satellite authentication/authorization (user/role).
 2. Must be able to execute reports immediately, or scheduled.
 3. Must be able to group reports logically.
 4. Must be able to generate different formats (.csv, .html, .txt, ...)
 5. Must be able to easily add/modify reports (including report formatting).
 6. Must be able to run reports against multiple satellites, and aggregate data if desired.
 7. Must be able to notify users upon report completion (email).
 8. Must be able to accept report criteria input from user.

=== Source ===
Telemetry is current located in: /playpen/Telemetry in the spacewalk git repo -> [[https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk/browser/playpen/Telemetry]]
=== Installation ===

Telemetry is designed to run on any client-system.  It can be run on the Spacewalk server, but not necessarily.

 * PyYAML (report config)

=== Sample Reports ===

Telemetry contains a few sample canned reports.  The reports are installed in ''/usr/share/telemetry''.

 * /scripts   -> contains the xmlrpc client reports scripts (these are executable on the cmd-line or via the Telemetry webui.
 * /config    -> contains the report configuration files.
 * /templates -> contains the output format templates.

The report configuration files will '''need''' to be updated with the proper url for your Spacewalk server(s), and report directory.


{{{
cd /usr/share/telemetry/config
vi systemDetails.conf
}}}

{{{
Name: System Details Report
Description: This report provides a list of systems and supporting details (entitlements, channel subscriptions, & system groups.

Report_Script: systemDetailsReport.py

Satellites:
- http://rlx-1-16.rhndev.redhat.com/rpc/api  # Change this to point to the api url for your Spacewalk server(s). #

APIVersions:
- 5.1.0 Java
- 5.1.1 Java

Aggregate: no

Templates:

}}}




=== Config Data Dictionary ===

 Name::
     The name of the Report.

 Description::
     A brief description of the Report.

 Report_Script::
     The .py xmlrpc client script file used to gather report data.  Script needs to be in the ''/usr/share/telemetry/scripts'' directory.

 Satellites::
     The url of the xmlrpc API interface on your Spacewalk server(s).  Multiple servers can be added on separate lines.

 APIVersions::
     The supported versions of the Spacewalk xmlrpc API specification.

 Aggregate::
     A simple boolean value used when specifying multiple Spacewalk servers to indicate whether or not to aggregate the data into a single report.

 Templates::
     The report templates that can be used with this report.  The templates need to be in the ''/usr/share/telemetry/templates'' directory. Currently, the supported types are: txt, csv, & html.

 Report_Dir::
     The directory where the generated reports should be saved.

 Report_Name::
     The name that will be given to the generated reports.  The format will be: Report_Name + datetimestamp + output type (.txt, .csv, .html).
 
 Criteria::
     (''Optional'') User supplied criteria for the generated report. 

 * name: The name of the criterion.
 * label The label of the criterion (used for the webui form field input.)
 * type  The type of the criterion (csv, txt, bool).
 * cols  The number of columns or horizontal size of the text field or text area for webui input.
 * rows  The number of rows or vertical size of the text field or text area for webui input.
 * required Boolean value to specify whether the criterion is optional.

=== Web UI ===

The webui is currently leveraging the simple development webserver that ships with Django.   Todo: Investigate deployment on Apache/mod_python.
