
== Telemetry ==

Telemetry is the code name for a simple template-based reporting engine for Spacewalk.  Telemetry uses the xmlrpc scripting [http://www.redhat.com/spacewalk/documentation/api/0.2/ API] to fetch data from Spacewalk servers.  It is written completely in Python, leveraging [http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/ Cheetah] for templating, cron for scheduling, and [http://www.djangoproject.com/ Django] for the webui.
