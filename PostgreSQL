= Spacewalk with PostgreSQL backend =

Historically, RHN Satellite and thus Spacewalk servers required Oracle RDBMS as database backend. In order to make the whole Spacewalk project use open source software, we are adding support for PostgreSQL as database backend.

This is a page describing the status of the PostgreSQL support as of 21th April, 2011, Spacewalk version 1.4.

== Functionality known to work ==

Spacewalk on PostgreSQL still only has limited functionality. Areas known to work are:

 * content sync with satellite-sync and spacewalk-repo-sync;
 * rhnpush;
 * client registration;
 * yum operations;
 * Spacewalk Proxy activation.
 * spacewalk-reports
 * configuration management

Anything else might, but most likely will not work for you.

Things working on PostgreSQL in Spacewalk nightly include:

 * everything except monitoring

== Get the PostgreSQL server running ==

Follow [wiki:PostgreSQLServerSetup].

== Install the spacewalk-postgresql and configure it ==

When installing Spacewalk, you install {{{spacewalk-postgresql}}} which should give you correct backend and dependencies.
{{{
# yum install spacewalk-postgresql
}}}

Then, when you run {{{spacewalk-setup}}}, you'll be asked for connection information:

{{{
# spacewalk-setup --disconnected
** Database: Setting up database connection for PostgreSQL backend.
Hostname (leave empty for local)? 
Database? spaceschema
Username? spaceuser
Password? spacepw
** Database: Populating database.
}}}

The {{{spacewalk-setup}}} finishes and you are good to go -- enjoy your Spacewalk on PostgreSQL!

== Migrating existing Spacewalk on Oracle ==

If you have an existing Spacewalk with Oracle backend installation, you can use it as a base of your Spacewalk on PostgreSQL setup -- see [wiki:PostgreSQLFromOracle].

== When you hit error ==

For the above mentioned areas that are known to work, if you hit a problem, please file bugzilla.

For other areas, please help us by submitting a patch to spacewalk-devel@redhat.com mailing list. See below for how to fix issues.

== Info for developers ==

=== Porting to PostgreSQL ===

At [wiki:PostgreSQLPortingGuide] we list issues that we were addressing while making {{{spacewalk-setup}}}, {{{satellite-sync}}}, {{{spacewalk-repo-sync}}}, client registration, as well as WebUI pages work. Please use it as a reference of fixes when you hit an issue and want to create a patch for it.

=== Database schema ===

When Spacewalk is installed and {{{spacewalk-setup}}} run for the first time, database is populated with necessary database objects via {{{psql}}} from {{{/etc/sysconfig/rhn/postgres/main.sql}}}. So this is the file you want to edit if you need to fix something in the schema on your installation. Then rerun {{{spacewalk-setup}}}, it will prompt to clear the schema. Watch {{{/var/log/rhn/populate_db.log}}} for any errors during population of the schema in the PostgreSQL database.

Of course, to preserve the changes, you need to get them to the Spacewalk git repo, so that they get to the next nightly spacewalk-schema package. For PostgreSQL, the schema is compiled from files in the {{{schema/spacewalk/common/}}} and {{{schema/spacewalk/postgres/}}} directories in the Spacewalk git repo. A file should be either in the {{{common/}}} or in {{{postgres/}}} subdirectory, not in both.

==== TODO ====

 * Not all Oracle sources have their PostgreSQL counterparts.
   * Run {{{perl schema-source-sanity-check.pl -I}}} to see what needs to be worked on.
   * When you fix PostgreSQL schema source to be equivalent to the Oracle file, add line {{{-- oracle equivalent source sha1 ...}}} to the start of the PostgreSQL file, with SHA1 of the Oracle file there.
 * I would like us to check upon rpm build time that every file contains just what its filename says it should contain -- triggers in its own files, table files with just table and index DDL, etc.
 * The {{{chameleon}}} tool is used to generate DDL from {{{common/}}} but it only seems to work for tables. Do we want to extend that tool, or drop it completely?
