
= PostgreSQL and blobs and Hibernate =

There is a problem with declarations like

{{{
<property name="certBlob" column="CERT" not-null="true" type="blob" />
}}}

as reported in https://www.redhat.com/archives/spacewalk-devel/2010-June/msg00037.html -- it does not map to bytea that we use as the PostgreSQL columns in place of Oracle's blobs.

For now, I have removed that column from my local repo

{{{

}}}

but obviously better solution is needed.

 * I've tried changing the type to {{{binary}}} but that breaks Oracle. But maybe with some more changes to the application code {{{binary}}} is the way to go for both database backends?
 * Another possibility would be to tweak the JDBC driver or the dialect of that driver not to try the oid approach for blobs.
