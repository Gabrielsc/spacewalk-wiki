||G12||Monitoring||Are we converting the monitoring module?|| done || tsanders || Yes ||
||G13||Remove dead java queries|| Remove the dead java data source queries from git ||  || dgoodwin || ||
||G14||Orafce|| Orafce requires Postgres 8.2; port Orafce to Postgres 8.1 and perhaps 7.4; packaging issues? || || bmomjian || ||
||G15|| Setup schema review meeting || Have developers review schema beforehand, meet to discuss core tables and answer questions with as many developers as possible. || || jortel || ||
||G16|| db-control || what about the RHN db-control stuff.  It's probably oracle based || || || ||

 ![1]:: 
 RHEL-4 includes postgres 7.4 and RHEL-5 includes postgres 8.1.  The latest postgres is 8.3.8.
 7.4 has the following limitations (Exceptions, Save Points) appear to be applicable to spacewalk.
