== Project Tasks ==

Project tasks are work items that need to be tracked.  They are different then issues in that items listed here
simply need to be completed and are not necessarily risks to the project.

||'''Name'''||'''Description'''||'''Status'''||'''Assigned'''||'''Notes'''
||1. Dead Query Script||Write a script to: find queries defined but not referenced in perl code; find queries defined but not referenced in java code; find queries defined in both (perl migrated to java).|| ||dgoodwin|| ||
||2. Perl Data Source||Estimate to update perl ''data source'' to use java data source XML files|| || shughes || Syntax only, __not__ feature parity||
||3. Query Script||Enhance script to list files containing SQL; provides file and query counts|| || zeus || [attachment:file_query_count script]||
||4. Query File List||Publish ''final'' list of files containing queries that need to be tagged.  This item will be created by merging script task(s) output|| || || ||
||5. Add comments||Determine how to add SQL comments to every query|| ||  || ||
||6. Postgres Schema||Create test version of Postgres schema, for testing of queries|| ||  || ||
||7. Database Versions||What is the minimum supported version of  Postgres?|| ||  || ![1] This will depend on targeted versions of RHEL||
||8. Custom Data Type||Add EVR_T data type with aggregate|| ||  || ||
||9. Prepare git branch||Either clean up the existing postgres branch, or create a new branch and ''cherry pick'' Devin's changes|| ||dgoodwin|| ||
||10. Postgres Dev Packages||Create a devel yum repo containing custom packages required for satellite to use __both__ oracle and postgres|| || dgoogwin|| ||
||11. Postgres DDL|| Publish an initial postgres schema generated by oratopg  || || dgoodwin,bmomjian || To be cleaned up by bmomjian ||
||12. Sample Dataset||Create a sample database dataset that can be loaded in both oracle and postgres to be used by developers|| || jortel||||
||13. Monitoring||Are we converting the monitoring module?|| ||  || ||
||14. Remove dead perl queries|| Remove the dead perl queries from git || || dgoodwin ||
||15. Orafce|| Orafce requires Postgres 8.2; port Orafce to Postgres 8.1 and perhaps 7.4; packaging issues? || || bmomjian ||
||16. Comment all queries|| Add SQL comments to all queries || || bmomjian ||

=== Notes ===
 ![1]:: 
 RHEL-4 includes postgres 7.4 and RHEL-5 includes postgres 8.1.  The latest postgres is 8.3.8.
 7.4 has the following limitations (Exceptions, Save Points) appear to be applicable to spacewalk.
