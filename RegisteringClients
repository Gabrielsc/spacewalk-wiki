Instructions for registering client systems you with to manage with Spacewalk

= Fedora 9 =

  1. Install the Fedora Spacewalk yum repository by creating a file in /etc/yum.repos.d with the following contents:
    {{{
[spacewalk]
name=Spacewalk
baseurl=http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/fedora/$releasever/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
}}}
    * NOTE: Developers internal can use this URL instead until site is live: baseurl=http://fjs-0-11.rhndev.redhat.com/yum/fedora/9/i386
  1. Install client packages:
    {{{
yum install rhn-client-tools rhn-check 
    }}}
    * TODO: are rhn-setup and rhn-setup-gnome needed? rhns dependency needs to be sorted out if so.
  1. Fake the base channel to be a non-fedora one. We need to include fedora-release as a valid product in the db. This is get the registration working for RHEL-5 and get yum-plugin installed.

* If we have a fedora channel with packages hosted on the satellite, We don't have to do this. We just register with an activation key and associate the custom fedora channel to this client.

  rhnreg_ks --activationkey=<key-with-fedora-custom-channel>

* install a redhat-release rpm for rhel-5 or edit /usr/share/rhn/up2date_client/up2dateUtils.py's getRelease() to return '5Server'

* register your box to hosted/sat. Now this should go smoothly and you should see your fedora box subscribed to rhel-5 base channel.

* install yum-rhn-plugin and run yum

* it should error while loading the plugin. disable the plugin /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf

* install m2crypto
  $  yum install m2crypto
  Loading "security" plugin
