== Release Cycles ==

Each Spacewalk release will be roughly two (2) months in duration. See [https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/spacewalk/roadmap Roadmap] for upcoming releases.

== Mechanics ==
We will build our non Fedora RPMs using an internal Red Hat instance of Koji.  

The Koji server lives at [http://koji.rhndev.redhat.com/koji spacewalk koji]
to build you need a user cert,  you need to ask Dennis for it
a spacewalk koji config file in ~/.koji/spacewalk-config
{{{
[koji]

;configuration for koji cli tool

;url of XMLRPC server
server = http://koji.rhndev.redhat.com/kojihub

;url of web interface
weburl = http://koji.rhndev.redhat.com/koji

;url of package download site
pkgurl = http://koji.rhndev.redhat.com/mnt/koji/packages

;path to the koji top directory
;topdir = /mnt/koji

;configuration for SSL athentication

;client certificate
cert = ~/.spacewalk.cert

;certificate of the CA that issued the client certificate
ca = ~/.spacewalk-ca.cert

;certificate of the CA that issued the HTTP server certificate
serverca = ~/.spacewalk-ca.cert
}}}
the ~/.spacewalk-ca.cert file can be found linked at the bottom of this page

== Get your packages tagged, get your packages built ==
To have a particular package in a Spacewalk release, we should know from which
commit we plan to take the code. To to that, I suggest you do
{{{
	make test-srpm
}}}
and try to create test .src.rpm package.

Note that this .src.rpm will be created from your local HEAD (on
whatever branch your are), it will have that commit's SHA1 in name
and if will also appear in the .tar.gz within that .src.rpm. It's
done that way on purpose, so that .src.rpm from your local HEAD is
not confused with "official" package releases.

When you get .src.rpm, try to rpmbuild it on your Fedora and RHEL. Fix
any problems that appear, do more commits, revert commits, etc.

When you are happy with the .src.rpm, you should run either
{{{
	make tag-release
}}}
or
{{{
	make tag-minor-release
}}}

and tag your HEAD with name-version-release, and push that commit and
tag to the upstream repository. Run
{{{
	make help
}}}
to see how. After you have your tag in the upstream repository, you
can do
{{{
	make srpm
}}}
which will create .src.rpm, this time named with the version-release
of the latest tag for that package. You should build this .src.rpm
in koji. Note that for koji, the command is
{{{
	make srpm DIST='.el5'
        koji -c ~/.koji/spacewalk-config build --nowait dist-5E-sw-0.4-candidate /path/to/that/package-version-release.el5.src.rpm
}}}
so that the {{{%{dist}}}} tag is populated correctly.

== Branching a release ==
When we're nearing the end of a release cycle, we need to branch the release.

Make sure your {{{master}}} is clean and updated:
{{{
   git checkout master
   git pull (make sure things are clean)
}}}

Now create a local branch, where x.y is the release number, i.e. 0.2:
{{{
   git checkout -b release-x.y
}}}

Then, push your branch to the remote server, where x.y is the release number:
{{{
   git push origin release-x.y:refs/heads/RELEASE-x.y
}}}

Please note that all changes made to a branch must also be made to master. (git cherry-pick very useful for this)
