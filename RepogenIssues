Seeing some trouble with repo generation for a particular channel?

{{{
1.  rm -rf /var/cache/rhn/repodata/CHANNEL_LABEL/*
2.  sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe
3.  sql> delete from rhnRepoRegenQueue
4.  sql> commit;
5.  sql> quit
6.  Then run 'yum clean all && yum list' on a client that is connected to that channel
7.  Monitor /var/cache/rhn/repodata/CHANNEL_LABEL/ for files being created. 
}}}

Still not working?   Make sure taskomatic is running:

/etc/init.d/taskomatic restart


and look for error messages in /var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log
