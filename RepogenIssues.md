Seeing some trouble with repo generation for a particular channel?


    1.  rm -rf /var/cache/rhn/repodata/CHANNEL_LABEL/*
    2.  sqlplus spacewalk/spacewalk@xe
    3.  sql> delete from rhnRepoRegenQueue
    4.  sql> commit;
    5.  sql> quit
    6.  Then run 'yum clean all && yum list' on a client that is connected to that channel
    7.  Monitor /var/cache/rhn/repodata/CHANNEL_LABEL/ for files being created. 

Still not working?   Make sure taskomatic is running:

/etc/init.d/taskomatic restart


and look for error messages in /var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log


Are you seeing the following in the log file:


    | com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.core.TaskomaticDaemon - Tomcat is not up yet, sleeping 4   â”‚ mccun934
    | seconds

Most likely something is interfering with the apache configs:

    # grep VirtualHost  /etc/httpd/conf.d/*

Look for any <VirtualHost *:80> or <VirtualHost 192.168.0.1:80>  entries   (Where 192.168.0.1 is your ip address)
