== Spacewalk and OpenSCAP ==

Project to integrate OpenSCAP to Spacewalk has started.


With Spacewalk 1.7, user is able:
 * schedule XCCDF scan for a given machine through FrontendAPI
 * obtain summary of the scan results through spacewalk-reports tool.

== How to perform scan ==
 * Prerequisites:
   * For the server side: Spacewalk 1.7 or higher
   * For the client: spacewalk-oscap package from spacewalk-client repo
   * Distribute the XCCDF content to client machines (e.g by rpm)
 * Schedule scan through FrontendAPI (system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan)
   * The 'path' parameter point to content location on the client system.
   * The 'parameters' represents additional arguments for oscap tool, e.g d
 * Wait for action to be picked-up
 * Get results by spacewalk-reports tool.
