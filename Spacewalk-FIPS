= Spacewalk and FIPS-140-2 =

''FIPS 140-2 (FIPS = Federal Information Processing Standard)'' is a U.S. government security standard used to accredit cryptographic modules. It outlines a set of requirements that must be adhered to by any US-government certified cryptographic module (hardware or software).

=== FIPS 140-2 Annexes ===

* Annex A: Approved Security Functions

* Annex B: Approved Protection Profiles

* Annex C: Approved Random Number Generators

Operating systems supported by Spacewalk (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora) allow turning FIPS mode on. In FIPS mode, the operating system is doing integrity checking and enforces minimum configurations for FIPS-aware cryptography
software (OpenSSL, libgcrypt).

Spacewalk 2.2 introduced support for FIPS 140-2 standard. Spacewalk support for the FIPS standard allows:

* Installing and running your Spacewalk on an operating system with FIPS mode on
* Running your registered clients in FIPS mode
