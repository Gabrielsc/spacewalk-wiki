## Oracle XE 10g backup

### Setting up archivelog for online backup




Make sure nothing is connected to the Oracle database:


    # spacewalk-service stop


    bash-3.2# su oracle
    bash-3.2$ . /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/bin/oracle_env.sh
    bash-3.2$ sqlplus /nolog
     connect / as sysdba
     shutdown immediate
     startup mount
     alter database archivelog;
     alter database open;
     SELECT LOG_MODE FROM SYS.V$DATABASE;
     quit
    
    You should get:
     SQL> SELECT LOG_MODE FROM SYS.V$DATABASE;
     
     LOG_MODE
     ------------
     ARCHIVELOG
     --

Make sure Oracle XE restart works fine:

    # service oracle-xe restart
### Run (online) backup



The backup script can be found at `/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/config/scripts/backup.sh`.
Please note that you have to run it under the *oracle* system user.


    bash-3.2$ HOME=/tmp /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/config/scripts/backup.sh
    Doing online backup of the database.
    Backup of the database succeeded.
    Log file is at /tmp/oxe_backup_current.log.

Location of the backup files: /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/flash_recovery_area/XE/
### Restore backup



The restore script can be found at `/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/config/scripts/restore.sh`.
Please note that you have to run it under the *oracle* system user.


    -bash-3.2$ HOME=/tmp /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/config/scripts/restore.sh 
    This operation will shut down and restore the database. Are you sure [Y/N]?y
    Restore in progress...
    Restore of the database succeeded.
    Log file is at /tmp/oxe_restore.log.
    Press ENTER key to exit

Do one more Oracle XE server restart:


    # service oracle-xe restart
## Postgres backup and restore

### Creating the backup




Ensure that spacewalk is not using the postgres database:

    # spacewalk-service stop

This procedure assumes that spacewalk is the only application using this postgres database.

Create a full postgres backup.

    # su - postgres -c  'pg_dumpall > /var/lib/pgsql/backups/full_postgres_backup-`date +%Y%m%d`.sql'

Don't forget to restart once the sql dump has finished.

    # spacewalk-service start
### Restoring from the backup



This assumes that you'd be happy to drop all databases and install from the backup perform with a pg_dumpall command.

Stop spacewalk from accessing the postgres database.

    # spacewalk-service stop

Switch to postgres user.

    # su - postgres

Define some temp variables, adjust appropriately as per your setup.

    # SPACEWALK_DB_NAME=spacewalkdb
    # SPACEWALK_DB_BACKUPFILE=/var/lib/pgsql/backups/full_postgres_backup-20140323.sql

Use temp variables from above to drop the existing database and restore from the backup, then exit from postgres user's shell.

    # dropdb $SPACEWALK_DB_NAME
    # createdb $SPACEWALK_DB_NAME
    # psql -e -d $SPACEWALK_DB_NAME -f $SPACEWALK_DB_BACKUPFILE
    # exit

Don't forget to restart once you've restored the database.

    # spacewalk-service start
