=== What is Spacewalk ===

That's the first thing posted here:  See https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk :)

=== How long has Spacewalk been around? ===

Red Hat Network first started around 2001 as a hosted application.  RHN later spawned a stand alone product called Red Hat Satellite.  Spacewalk as a project officially became an open source, community driven product in June 2008 -- it is the upstream for Red Hat Satellite.   

== Spacewalk Architecture ==

=== Why do you use Oracle?  Any plans for supporting other databases? ===

Originally the Spacewalk code base was used as a hosted application and Oracle was a good choice for a hosted application in 2001.  Over the years open source databases such as Postgres and MySQL have improved tremendously in terms of stability, speed, and scalability.  We have not had the resources allocated in the past to add support for an open source database but want to do so soon.

=== What if I don't have Oracle? ==

See the instructions here for information about the XE version:  OracleXeSetup

== Perl, Python, and Java OH MY! ==  

"Why do you use 3 different languages in your product?"   The original WebUI for the Spacewalk code base was purely Perl.  As time went on scalability issues came in to play, which was worrisome because developers who knew (and wanted to develop in) Perl were somewhat hard to come by.  This was to be solved by migrating to Java.  Sadly migrating to Java took longer to accomplish than anticipated and thus is not complete.  All new web development is done in Java and the Perl is only maintained.  We continually migrate pages to Java as new features need to be added to the pages, but it is not a top priority.

== Using Spacewalk with RHEL, and Comments on Versions ==

== The Future == 

== What About Integrating Technology X? ==

We are looking to include "best of breed" open source technology where possible and this is one of our major priorities.  So one of the things we will be doing in the future is integrating support to use [http://cobbler.et.redhat.com Cobbler] for provisioning in Spacewalk/Satellite.  We are also going to be looking at upgrading over components over time as well.  Input is always welcome.  We are also looking to break Spacewalk down into smaller more consumable subprojects to make them usable by other projects and tools.   See also the RoadMap
