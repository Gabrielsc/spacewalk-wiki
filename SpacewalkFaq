== General ==

=== What is Spacewalk ===

That's the first thing posted here:  See https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk :)

=== How long has Spacewalk been around? ===

Red Hat Network (RHN) first started around 2001 as a hosted application.  Two years later RHN spawned a stand alone product called Red Hat Network Satellite.  Spacewalk as a project officially became an open source, community driven product in June 2008 -- it is the upstream for Red Hat Network Satellite.

=== Who designed Spacewalk logo? Can I get hi-res picture? ===

See Logo page on our wiki.

== Installation ==

=== Is a Satellite/Spacewalk certificate required to use Spacewalk? ===
Traditionally for Red Hat Satellite a Satellite certificate was required to use the product and listed what channel families and entitlements (and how many) the customer had purchased.  Spacewalk still uses a certificate, but it is provided for free and activated upon installation.  You shouldn't ever have to worry about it expiring or about running out of entitlements.

== Spacewalk Architecture ==

=== Why do you use Oracle?  Any plans for supporting other databases? ===

Originally the Spacewalk code base was used as a hosted application and Oracle was a good choice for a hosted application in 2001.  Over the years open source databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL have improved tremendously in terms of stability, speed, and scalability.  We have not had the resources allocated in the past to add support for an open source database but want to do so soon.

=== What if I don't have Oracle? ===

See the instructions here for information about the XE version:  OracleXeSetup

=== Perl, Python, and Java OH MY! ===  

"Why do you use 3 different languages in your product?"   The original WebUI for the Spacewalk code base was purely Perl.  As time went on scalability issues came in to play, which was worrisome because developers who knew (and wanted to develop in) Perl were somewhat hard to come by.  This was to be solved by migrating to Java.  Sadly migrating to Java took longer to accomplish than anticipated and thus is not complete.  All new development is done in either Java or Python, we are only maintaining the Perl at this point in hopes of migrating it all to Java.  We continually migrate pages to Java as new features need to be added to the pages, but it is not a top priority.

=== Why are there two XML-RPC API endpoints? ===

Originally there was only a backend/business-logic API (within the application's Python layer) making the Satellite server accessible to clients via XML-PRC.  Documents were not published for this API and it wasn't intended to be used by anything but the pre-built client utilities (rhn_register, etc..).  The frontend/WebUI API (within the application's WebUI Java/Perl layer) was created so that users could write scripts and programs to interact with the Satellite and perform the same actions available within the UI.  This was done in the Java side of things since all of the manager code is already in Java and is well documented.

=== What languages can I use to interact with the XML-RPC APIs? ===

Any language that has XML-RPC bindings can be used to interact with the Spacewalk/Satellite APIs. XML-RPC is a common RPC standard for which most languages have bindings. So, you can exploit the available APIs with Python, TCL, Perl, or Ruby... or even C++ and .Net if you so desire. Many of our examples will be written in Python since it is the simplest and easiest to understand, but don't let that stop you from writing your API scripts in the language of your choosing.

=== What OSes are supported? ===

Currently Spacewalk can be used for Fedora, RHEL, or CentOS content.   As of Spacewalk 0.2, all of these can be managed in the same organization. However, for 0.1, you would have to create separate organizations for each content provider.

Spacewalk's server itself is currently only tested to run on RHEL 5. (i386)

== The Future == 

=== What about integrating technology X? ===

We are looking to include "best of breed" open source technology where possible and this is one of our major priorities.  So one of the things we will be doing in the future is integrating support to use [http://cobbler.et.redhat.com Cobbler] for provisioning in Spacewalk/Satellite.  We are also going to be looking at upgrading other components over time as well.  Input is always welcome.  We are also looking to break Spacewalk down into smaller more consumable subprojects to make them usable by other projects and tools.   See also the TheRoadmap.  If there is something you are interested in, the best thing to do would be to bring it up on the lists.

=== What kind of community contributions are you interested in? ===

Everything!  Ideas, feedback, testing, and patches are all welcome.  If there is something you don't like or would like to see improved, let us know.  See the "Communicate" section on the bottom page for some initial pointers.   We'll admit some things are relatively complex for newcomers feature wise, but over time, we're looking to simplify things as much as possible to make things easy to dive in and get involved with.  If you see an area where the documentation is lacking, please let us know, and we'll help you out.   Also, keep in mind that this is a Wiki, so you can help expand our documentation sections as well!
