= Frequently Asked Questions =

== General ==
 * What is Spacewalk?
  * Spacewalk is a systems management application 

 * How long has Spacewalk been around?
  * The original code base was first started around 2001 as a hosted product.  It was later split into a stand alone product called Red Hat Satellite.  Spacewalk was officially born on June 18, 2008 as an open source, community driven product which is the upstream for Red Hat Satellite.

== Spacewalk Architecture ==

=== Why do you use Oracle? ===

Originally the Spacewalk code base was used as a hosted application and Oracle was a good choice for a hosted application in 2001.  Over the years open source databases such as Postgres and MySQL have improved tremendously in terms of stability, speed, and scalability.  We have not had the resources allocated in the past to add support for an open source database but want to do so soon.

== Perl, Python, and Java OH MY! ==  

"Why do you use 3 different languages in your product?"   The original WebUI for the Spacewalk code base was purely Perl.  As time went on scalability issues came in to play, which was worrisome because developers who knew (and wanted to develop in) Perl were somewhat hard to come by.  This was to be solved by migrating to Java.  Sadly migrating to Java took longer to accomplish than anticipated and thus is not complete.  All new web development is done in Java and the Perl is only maintained.  We continually migrate pages to Java as new features need to be added to the pages, but it is not a top priority.

== The Future == 

== What About Integrating Technology X? ==

We are looking to include "best of breed" open source technology where possible and this is one of our major priorities.  So one of the things we will be doing in the future is integrating support to use [http://cobbler.et.redhat.com Cobbler] for provisioning in Spacewalk/Satellite.  We are also going to be looking at upgrading over components over time as well.  Input is always welcome.  We are also looking to break Spacewalk down into smaller more consumable subprojects to make them usable by other projects and tools.   See also the Roadmap
