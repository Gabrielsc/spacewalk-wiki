== General ==
 * What is Spacewalk?
  * Spacewalk is a systems management application 

 * How long has Spacewalk been around?
  * The original code base was first started around 2001 as a hosted product.  It was later split into a stand alone product called Red Hat Satellite.  Spacewalk was officially born on June 18, 2008 as an open source, community driven product which is the upstream for Red Hat Satellite.

 * Why do you use Oracle?
  * Originally the Spacewalk code base was used as a hosted application and Oracle was a good choice for a hosted application in 2001.  Over the years open source databases such as postgres and mysql have improved tremendously in terms of stability, speed, and scalability.  We have not had the resources allocated in the past to add support for an open source database but we hope to do so soon.

 * Perl, Python, and Java OH MY!  Why do you use 3 different languages in your product?
  * The original WebUI for the Spacewalk code base was purely perl.  As time went on scalability issues because a worrisome and developers who knew (and wanted to develop in) perl were harder and harder to come by.  This was to be solved by migrating to Java.  Sadly migrating to Java took longer to accomplish that anticipated and thus is not complete.  All new web development is done in Java and the Perl is only maintained.  We continually migrate pages to Java as new features need to be added to the pages, but it is not a top priority.
