 * What is Spacewalk?

 * How long has Spacewalk been around?
  * The original code base was first started around 2001 as a hosted product.  It was later split into a stand alone product called Red Hat Satellite.  Spacewalk was officially born on June 18, 2008 as an open source, community driven product which is the upstream for Red Hat Satellite.

 * Why do you use Oracle?
  * Originally the Spacewalk code base was used as a hosted application and Oracle was a good choice for a hosted application in 2001.  Over the years open source databases such as postgres and mysql and improved tremendously in terms of stability, speed, and scalability.  We have not had the resources allocated in the past to add support for an open source database but we hope to do so soon.
