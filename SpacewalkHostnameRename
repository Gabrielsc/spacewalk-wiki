spacewalk-hostname-rename script is an automated tool for re-configuration of Spacewalk server, in case its hostname or IP has changed.

It takes care of reconfiguration of /etc/rhn/rhn.conf file, SSL certificate, database, jabberd, cobbler, monitoring ... everything what's needed.

== Prerequisites ==
After the hostname/ip of the system gets changed, the systems shall be rebooted and spacewalk-hostname-rename script can be run. The script make some initial checks, whether the hostname is correctly set.

== How to use it ==

spacewalk-hostname-rename takes one mandatory argument - IP_ADDRESS regardless of whether the IP address has changed or not. If there is a need to generate a new SSL certificate, all necessary information will be asked interactivelly, unless it is specified by the options. When the system  hostname has not changed, the re-generation of a new SSL server certificate is not necessary. However, if at least one --ssl-*  option is specified, certificate generation is forced.

{{{
Usage:
   spacewalk-hostname-rename <IP_ADDRESS> [ --ssl-country=<SSL_COUNTRY> --ssl-state=<SSL_STATE> --ssl-org=<SSL_ORG> --ssl-orgunit=<SSL_ORGUNIT> --ssl-email=<SSL_EMAILl> --ssl-ca-password=<SSL_CA_PASSWORD>]
   spacewalk-hostname-rename { -h | --help }
}}}

IP_ADDRESS is the default ip address of the system used mainly for monitoring. It's a mandatory argument even if the IP didn't change.

== Rename process ==

{{{
# spacewalk-hostname-rename <my_ip_address>

== Additional info ==

spacewalk-hostname-rename logs to /var/log/rhn/rhn_hostname_rename.log

== What about clients? ==

Check serverURL value in /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date on every client registered to the renamed satellite and change it to the new hostname/ip value.
