= Spacewalk installation with users & groups defined in LDAP =

This page contains useful information in case you are deploying Spacewalk in an environment, where
it is common for user and group information to be pulled from an LDAP server.

Note, that here we mean unix user accounts and groups, that are normally created during package installation (for example:
apache, tomcat, nocpulse, ...). [[BR]]
Instructions contained here do not describe how to setup your Spacewalk
server to authenticate users accessing Spacewalk web ui and API against a centralized identity service (LDAP, Kerberos).

Setting up an environment for Spacewalk to play nice with users & groups defined in LDAP consists of two basic steps:

 * Creating user and group records in LDAP

 * Setting up the client -- supposedly the system that Spacewalk is about to be deployed on


----


== Creating user and groups in LDAP ==

Let's assume the following:

 * you have your LDAP server configured, up and running

 * your database superuser is "admin"

 * base of your organization is "dc=organization,dc=org"

These values were chosen for the simplicity of the whole description, values for your environment may be different.

Spacewalk installation requires the following:

 * users: ''apache'', ''oracle'', ''nocpulse'', ''tomcat'', ''jabber''

 * groups: ''apache'', ''oracle'', ''tomcat'', ''nocpulse'', ''dba'', ''jabber''

 * all ''apache'', ''oracle'', ''nocpulse'', ''tomcat'', ''jabber'' need to be created as system accounts (that is uid & gid < 500)

 * ''oracle'', ''nocpulse'', ''tomcat'' have ''apache'' as their secondary group

 * ''oracle'' is has ''dba'' as its secondary group

For convenience and more details, see file users-groups.ldif attached to this page. Edit this file to reflect the reality of your environment:

 * edit the ''dc'' values (in the example set to "dc=organization,dc=org")

 * edit the ''userPassword'' values (in the example set to MD5 encoded string 'password') 

Deploy the ldif file:

{{{
# ldapadd -x -D "cn=admin,dc=organization,dc=org" -W -f users-groups.ldif
}}}

----


== Client setup (i.e. the system your Spacewalk will be deployed to) ==

Make sure you have nss_ldap & authconfig packages installed:

{{{
# yum install nss_ldap authconfig
}}}

Run authconfig-tui: 
{{{
# authconfig-tui
}}}

and do:

* check "Use LDAP" in User information section

* check "Use LDAP Authentication" in Authentication section

* optionally, you may choose to use nscd to cache retrieved information (User Information section)

      └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘       
}}}

Proceed with next configuration window and put in appropriate values for your environment:

{{{
             ┌─────────────────┤ LDAP Settings ├─────────────────┐              
             │                                                   │              
             │          [ ] Use TLS                              │              
             │  Server: ldap://10.34.32.131/____________________ │              
             │ Base DN: dc=organization,dc=org__________________ │              
             │                                                   │              
             │         ┌──────┐                  ┌────┐          │              
             │         │ Back │                  │ Ok │          │              
             │         └──────┘                  └────┘          │              
             │                                                   │              
             │                                                   │              
             └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘              
}}}

Now open file /etc/ldap.conf and look for this directive:

{{{
nss_initgroups_ignoreusers
}}}

If you see tomcat in the list following it, remove it.

Now you should be able to retrieve user & group information via LDAP:

{{{
# getent passwd oracle
oracle:x:101:103:oracle:/usr/lib/oracle/xe:/bin/bash
# getent group apache
apache:*:48:oracle,nocpulse,tomcat
}}}

If your LDAP server & client setup was successful, you may proceed with Spacewalk installation now.

== Troubleshooting ==

Use ldapsearch utility to retrieve information from your LDAP server:

{{{
# ldapsearch -x -b 'dc=organization,dc=org' 'objectclass=*'
}}}


If you are running nscd and are getting weird results, try to invalidate nscd cache:

{{{
# nscd -i hosts
# nscd -i group
# nscd -i passwd
}}}
