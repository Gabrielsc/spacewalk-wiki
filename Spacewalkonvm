= Running Spacewalk on a Virtual machine (under construction) =

This Page describes the steps needed to achieve the following '''targets''';


* Do not use any graphical tooling
* Create a multi disk VM
* Install a bare minimal fedora 10 x86_64
* Install Spacewalk 0.5 x86_64 using internal DB and Web interfase (layered setup is later)
* Make sure that spacewalk starts to provision fedora 10
* Make sure automatic updates of fedora 10 are in place
