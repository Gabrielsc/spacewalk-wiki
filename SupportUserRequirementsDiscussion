The following are notes from a discussion between jdob and dgoodwin regarding the definition of the support user role and its function.

There seem to be two things being discussed in relation to the support user role:
 * Read only access to the web UI
 * Auditing features (for instance, system searching across trusted orgs)

For the purposes of this discussion, all of the new auditing features are presumed to fall under a new UI tab (the Support User tab).

These two features lead to a number of questions:
 1. Does a user with the Support User role see all of the default tabs (Systems, Channels, etc.) or simply the Support User tab?
  * If the support user does see all tabs, we'll have to add checks on all of these pages to ensure that any writeable functionality is disabled.
   * Despite being a lot of legwork, we run into a conflict if a user is assigned the Support User role and another role (e.g. System Groups Admin). Do we assume that the readonly nature of the Support User role is overridden by having another role assigned?
 1. Along the same lines, can the Support User role be assigned in conjunction with other roles?
  * This would be desirable if, for instance, an admin also wanted access to the new search abilities.
  * Again, we run into the question of how the read only aspect of the Support User role gets resolved with the admin roles.
 1. Are the audit features and read only user necessarily the same thing? Should they be implemented as two distinct options, an Audit role and a read only flag?
  * This approach makes the Support User tab a simple addition if the role is present, similar to the Admin menu for admins.
  * Again, this requires fitting in an entire UI with checking to disable writeable actions when the user is flagged as read only.
  * There may be a desire for access to certain admin menus with read only access, however this seems like a contradiction to have a read only admin.
