If you see any issues using the new OCI driver, there are a few things you need to do:

Edit /etc/rhn/rhn.conf and change:
{{{
hibernate.connection.driver_proto=jdbc:oracle:oci
}}}
to
{{{
hibernate.connection.driver_proto=jdbc:oracle:thin
}}}


If you are using the logdriver (Development only) then set it to Normal users ignore this:
{{{
hibernate.connection.driver_proto=jdbc:log:oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver:oracle:thin
}}}
