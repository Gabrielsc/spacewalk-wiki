== Unit Tests ==

If you have configured this project in eclipse, you can simply use eclipse to run unit tests.  Alternatively you can use ant.

To run a set of Unit tests within ant, simply run:
{{{
# ant -Dtestcase=ClassName test
}}}
where !ClassName is the name of the class containing unit tests.  For example:
{{{
# ant -Dtestcase=SystemHandlerTest test
}}}
would run all tests in !SystemHandlerTest.


To run all tests, simply run:
{{{
# ant invoke-tests-all
}}}
If you would like to specify a directory for the configuration, simply add
{{{
 -Drhn.config.dir=/etc/rhn
}}}
to the ant command.
