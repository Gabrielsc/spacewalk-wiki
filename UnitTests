== Unit Tests ==

If you have configured this project in eclipse, you can simply use eclipse to run unit tests.  Alternatively you can use ant.

In order to run the unit tests, the following must first be done:

  1. Ensure that the junit packages are installed. (e.g yum install junit ant-junit)
  1. Ensure that /etc/rhn/rhn.conf and /etc/rhn/default/*.conf are accessible by the user running the unit tests.

To run a set of Unit tests within ant, simply run:
{{{
# ant -Dtestcase=ClassName test
}}}
where !ClassName is the name of the class containing unit tests.  For example:
{{{
# ant -Dtestcase=SystemHandlerTest test
}}}
would run all tests in !SystemHandlerTest.


To run all tests, simply run:
{{{
# ant invoke-tests-all
}}}
If you would like to specify a directory for the configuration, simply add
{{{
 -Drhn.config.dir=/etc/rhn
}}}
to the ant command.
