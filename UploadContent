= Uploading rpm packages into Spacewalk =
----

In order to use Spacewalk, you'll need to upload rpm packages into it. At the moment there is no nice way to sync a yum repo with Spacewalk.  The following steps are covered in order to get your Spacewalk Server serving content.

        - [UploadContent#Creatinganewchannel Creating a new channel] to hold the rpm packages
        - [UploadContent#Downloadtherpmpackages Download the rpm packages] from a yum repo
        - [UploadContent#Uploadtherpmpackages Upload the rpm packages] into your Spacewalk Server


----


== Creating a new channel ==

In order to upload rpm packages into Spacewalk, you'll need to create a channel that will contain the packages.  There are two ways to create a new channel.  You can use the attached command line tool which uses the available XML-RPC API.

For example, to create a channel for Fedora 9:
{{{
./create_channel.py --label=fedora-9-i386 --name "Fedora 9 32-bit" --summary "32-bit Fedora 9 channel"


./create_channel.py
Usage: create_channel.py [options] --label <channel label> --name <channel name>

Options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --user=USER          username
  --password=PASSWORD  password
  --host=HOST          FQDN of your server
  --label=LABEL        channel label
  --name=NAME          channel name
  --summary=SUMMARY    channel summary
  --debug              enable debug output
None
}}}


The second way to create a new channel is to use your Spacewalk website.

At the top of your Spacewalk page within the navigation tabs you will see '''channels'''.

[[Image(channel1.png)]]

On the left hand navigation menu you will see '''Manage Channels'''.

[[Image(channel2.png)]]

On the upper right hand corner of the body of the webpage you should see '''Create New Channel'''.

[[Image(channel3.png)]]

Fill in the blanks accordingly and click '''Create New'''

== Download the rpm packages ==

There are many ways to download content (rpms) [http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/ rsync], [http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/ wget], [http://wiki.linux.duke.edu/YumUtils reposync], etc. Below we'll show two of these mechanisms: wget and reposync.

* '''using wget'''

One way of getting content is to use [http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/ wget] to fetch the packages from a given yum repo. While not the most elegant method, it works, using easily available tools. Let's get the Fedora 9 content and put them into a Fedora9 directory.

{{{
# mkdir Fedora9
# cd Fedora9
# wget -r -l1 --no-parent \
        http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/9/Everything/i386/os/Packages/
}}}

The same principal but for CentOS 5

{{{
# mkdir CentOS5
# cd CentOS5
# wget -r -l1 --no-parent \
        http://mirror.linux.duke.edu/pub/centos/5/os/x86_64/CentOS/
}}}

* '''using reposync'''

A more elegant method of getting packages for uploading, is using [http://wiki.linux.duke.edu/YumUtils reposync]. [http://wiki.linux.duke.edu/YumUtils YumUtils] has a really useful tool called [http://wiki.linux.duke.edu/YumUtils/RepoSync reposync] to synchronize packages to a local directory.

 - First, install yum-utils if it isn't already: 
{{{
yum install yum-utils
}}}
 - Install the desired repo in this case, fedora.
{{{
$ head /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo
[fedora]
name=Fedora $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/$releasever/Everything/$basearch/os/
mirrorlist=http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=fedora-$releasever&arch=$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY
}}}
 - Now pass in the repoid to reposync:
{{{
$ reposync --repoid=fedora
[fedora: 1     of 7390  ] Downloading Fedora/915resolution-0.5.3-1.fc7.i386.rpm
  915resolution-0.5.3-1.fc7 100% |=========================|  16 kB    00:00
[fedora: 2     of 7390  ] Downloading Fedora/AGReader-1.2-2.fc6.i386.rpm
  AGReader-1.2-2.fc6.i386.r 100% |=========================|  47 kB    00:00
[fedora: 3     of 7390  ] Downloading Fedora/AllegroOGG-1.0.3-3.fc6.i386.rpm
  AllegroOGG-1.0.3-3.fc6.i3 100% |=========================|  16 kB    00:00
  ...
}}}
 - Once the above step is done packages should be in the '''fedora''' directory:
{{{
$ ls -l fedora/Fedora/
  total 18936
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 root root   15960 2007-05-23 10:18 915resolution-0.5.3-1.fc7.i386.rpm
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 root root   48528 2007-05-23 10:18 AGReader-1.2-2.fc6.i386.rpm
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 root root   16687 2007-05-23 10:19 AllegroOGG-1.0.3-3.fc6.i386.rpm
  ...
}}}

----

== Upload the rpm packages ==


Finally, it's time to push the content into the server. Once you have the rpms, use [http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/RHNetwork/ref-guide/chan-mgmt/4.1.0/s1-custom-pkgs-upload-sat.html rhnpush] to push them to the Spacewalk server.

For example, to upload the content downloaded using '''reposync''' do the following:
{{{
rhnpush --channel=fedora-9-i386 --server=http://localhost/APP --dir=fedora
}}}

'''usage''' see also [http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/RHNetwork/ref-guide/chan-mgmt/4.1.0/s1-custom-pkgs-upload-sat.html rhnpush]
{{{
rhnpush --channel=<channel-label> --server=<hosturl>/APP --dir=<directory>
}}}

Note: Make sure ''/var/satellite'' exists and has owner:group ''apache'' before pushing.

Note: I found that the above failed on Fedora 9 Everything.  My work around was:

{{{
find . -name "*rpm" | xargs rhnpush --channel=fedora-9-i386 --server=http://localhost/APP -v --tolerant -u spacewalk -p spacewalk
}}}
