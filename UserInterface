= User interface for developers

Note: this documentation is based on the not yet merged bootstrap-css branch

== Basic user interface

== Lists

Lists are done with the ListTag and you should use the JSP tag whenever possible. However, to emulate the
look of a list, the tag generates the following structure:

{{{
#!text/html
<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <div class="panel-title">
      This is the title
    </div>
  </div>
  <table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="X">
          <!-- header pagination, addons, etc -->
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><th>Column1 header</th>...</tr>
    </thead>

  </table>
  <div class="panel-footer">
    <!-- Reference links -->
  </div>
</div>
}}}

If you need to use manual HTML, you can do a simple panel if you don't need the table (mind that you need a panel-body instead), and if you need a simple table you can skip the panel.
