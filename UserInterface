= User interface for developers

Note: this documentation is based on the not yet merged bootstrap-css branch

== Basic user interface

Basic styles like lists, forms, buttons, images, tables, notifications, pagination, progress bars, panels, etc are provided by Twitter Bootstrap 3.

You can find the documentation here: http://getbootstrap.com

== Icons

The (font) based icons are provided by Font-Awesome (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) . For the icon list see http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/

For how to use them, see http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/

For porting, normally you will port a tag like:

{{{
#!text/html
<img src="/img/$iconfile.gif" alt="image.key.message"/ border="0"/>
}}}

To

{{{
#!text/html
<i class="icon-$name"></i>
}}}

== Accesibility

If the icon is already just decorating a label, there is no need for something like the "alt" attribute in images.
If the icon is the only piece of user interface there, you can add a "title" attribute or use the Bootstrap "sr-only" class, which will be displayed in Screen Readers only:

{{{
#!text/html
<div class="sr-only"><bean:message key="image.key.message"/></div>
}}}

== Lists

Lists are done with the ListTag and you should use the JSP tag whenever possible. However, to emulate the
look of a list, the tag generates the following structure:

{{{
#!text/html
<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <div class="panel-title">
      This is the title
    </div>
  </div>
  <table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="X">
          <!-- header pagination, addons, etc -->
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><th>Column1 header</th>...</tr>
    </thead>

  </table>
  <div class="panel-footer">
    <!-- Reference links -->
  </div>
</div>
}}}

If you need to use manual HTML, you can do a simple panel if you don't need the table (mind that you need a panel-body instead), and if you need a simple table you can skip the panel.
