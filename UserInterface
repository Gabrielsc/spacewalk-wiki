= User interface for developers

Note: this documentation is based on the not yet merged bootstrap-css branch

== Basic user interface

Basic styles like lists, forms, buttons, images, tables, notifications, pagination, progress bars, panels, etc are provided by Twitter Bootstrap 3.

You can find the documentation here: http://getbootstrap.com

== Icons

The (font) based icons are provided by Font-Awesome (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) . For the icon list see http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/

For how to use them, see http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/

For porting, normally you will port a tag like:

{{{
#!text/html
<img src="/img/$iconfile.gif" alt="image.key.message" border="0" />
}}}

To

{{{
#!text/html
<i class="icon-$name"></i>
}}}

== Accesibility

If the icon is already just decorating a label, there is no need for something like the "alt" attribute in images.
If the icon is the only piece of user interface there, you can add a "title" attribute or use the Bootstrap "sr-only" class, which will be displayed in Screen Readers only:

{{{
#!text/html
<div class="sr-only"><bean:message key="image.key.message" /></div>
}}}

== Lists

Lists are done with the ListTag and you should use the JSP tag whenever possible. However, to emulate the
look of a list, the tag generates the following structure:

{{{
#!text/html
... addons
<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">This is the title</h3>
    ... addons
  </div>
  <table class="table table-striped">
    ...
  </table>
  <div class="panel-footer">
     .. addons
  </div>
</div>
...addons
}}}

If you need to use manual HTML, you can do a simple panel if you don't need the table (mind that you need a panel-body instead), and if you need a simple table you can skip the panel.

The structure of the generated list is like the following (in a pesudo markup HAML like format)

{{{
.spacewalk-list
  .spacewalk-list-top-addons
      .spacewalk-list-alphabar
      .spacewalk-list-top-addons-extra
  .spacewalk-list-top-extra
  .panel.panel-default
    .panel-heading
      .panel-title
        h3
      .spacewalk-list-head-addons
        .spacewalk-list-filter
        .spacewalk-list-head-addons-extra
      .spacewalk-list-head-extra
    table.table.table-striped
    thead ..
    tbody ..
    .panel-footer
      .spacewalk-list-footer-addons  
        .spacewalk-list-reflinks
        .spacewalk-list-footer-addons-extra
      .spacewalk-list-footer-extra
    .spacewalk-list-bottom-addons
      .spacewalk-list-pagination
      .spacewalk-list-bottom-addons-extra
    .spacewalk-list-bottom-extra
}}}

* `<meta name="page-decorator"` leaks into html... was not problem with xhtml 1.0 transitional, but is with html 5.
  Is this some kind of forgotten piece of code from old dark ages?
* ~~/rhn/ssm/index.do missing **ssm.overview.misc.delete** and **ssm.overview.misc.reboot** resource strings~~
* /rhn/systems/ssm/MigrateSystems.do popup menu (aka select) after 'Target Orgenization' is not styled

== usability ==
* ~~need of color icons - not clear on the /rhn/systems/Overview.do and other /rhn/systems/*.do pages, what systems are critical, inactive, ... - in legend there are colored version of these~~
 * tkasparek: 71c98a54d044621e53db0ce6ee292e864eb0960e
* ~~move the '+ create new ...' to the right and make it green, e.g. 'create new note' on /rhn/systems/details/Notes.do page~~ 845d79295a847d7c388b008b4ba6d54388af38ee
* make expanded sub-menu lighter than the higher level menu - e.g. /rhn/systems/SystemList.do page
* [jhutar] overall theme seems to have low contras to me, I have found this recommendations:
  * http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-CSS-TECHS/G17.html - Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, but there is also another recommendation speaking about 4.5:1
  * http://www.javascripter.net/faq/rgbtohex.htm - convert rgb(...) to hex notations if you are lazy like I'm
  * http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php - count contrast of two colors
  * I have tried these:
    * h1 (like "Overview") vs. body which gave me 9.51:1 - good but seems worse to me personally
    * menu item vs. its background gave me 5.13:1 - bad
    * when you fill something into the form, filled text vs. form (e.g. plain input row) is 4:0 - very bad
* [jhutar] In Systems -> <choose_your_system> when in "Details" note second level menu which should be smaller I believe (to express this is just sub-menu)
* API overview list shall be displayed on the right page side, e.g. /rhn/apidoc/handlers/SystemHandler.jsp
* differenciate info message vs. warning/error messages (used to be blue vs. red, now blue vs. blue)
* if multiple errors occurs only one error message is shown and other are ignored
* schedule date picker is not consistent with implementation on other pages:
  * SSM > Errata (/rhn/systems/ssm/ListPatches.do)
  * SSM > Misc > Reboot (/rhn/systems/ssm/misc/RebootSystem.do)
* pages doesn't implement "two phase" confirmation (i.e. confirmation page after submit):
  * SSM > Errata (/rhn/systems/ssm/ListPatches.do)
  * ~~SSM > Misc > Reboot (/rhn/systems/ssm/misc/RebootSystem.do)~~ eea3c6320bfc3dae8532844a7c0e71dcc5712c39
  * Systems > <System> > Schedule System Reboot
* Create user page (/rhn/users/CreateUser.do?account_type=into_org)
  * formerly Login: and Account Information: tables were aligned vertically 
  * prefix, firstNames and lastName inputs were aligned horizontally in a row (so label "First, Last Name*:" made sense but now it does not)
* List pagination and alpha bar
  * bar goes from 0..9A..Z on /rhn/systems/details/packages/PackageList.do but A..Z0..9 on /rhn/systems/SystemEntitlements.do and /network/systems/system_list/regular_in_channel_family.pxt
  * different set of pagination arrows on /network/systems/system_list/regular_in_channel_family.pxt
  * strange horizontal line separating A .. J | K .. Z on /network/systems/system_list/regular_in_channel_family.pxt
