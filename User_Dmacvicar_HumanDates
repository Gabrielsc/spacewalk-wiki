
== Problem ==

Spacewalk shows timestamps in lot of places of the user interface. Those timestamps require the user to think about them.

== Human dates ==

The patch allows to see the dates in a human format that is natural to the user. It adds a rhn:formatDateHuman that is used
very similarly to fmt:formatDate.

You can still hover and see details. Even more, the generated tag is a semantic tag that has the timestamp in the attributes, so javascript can still access the original data.

And of course, it is localized...
