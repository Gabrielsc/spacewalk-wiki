== Date and time picker ==

We propose an implementation that first, fixes the usability.

* Allows to select with mouse but also quickly enter values using a keyboard
* Is connected to the i18n system

After evaluation various datepickers combined with timepickers, the one used at facebook.com feels very usable, allowing quick usage both with mouse as with keyboard.

The result is a nice looking picker that looks like:

Clicking on the date field would open a calendar. But you can still just enter the date.
