
Beacon exports a significant chunk of operations through its xmlrpc API... This page is intended to get you up and running with sample client scripts, and implement a sample xmlrpc call in one of the handlers. Suppose the organization administrator of an organization wants to obtain a list of user in his/her organization, the org admin would typically generate a client script like this in python and run.
{{{
#!/usr/bin/env python
import xmlrpclib
SATELLITE_HOST = "<your satellite address>"
SATELLITE_URL = "http://%s/rpc/api" % SATELLITE_HOST
login = "admin"
password = "password"

#connect to the server
client = xmlrpclib.Server(SATELLITE_URL, verbose=0)
key = client.auth.login(login, password)
client.user.list_users(key)

}}}
